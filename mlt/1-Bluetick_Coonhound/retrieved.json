Check out some important considerations: American Coonhound puppy food : A high-quality puppy food with protein in the form of meats and vegetables that builds growing muscles and strong bones. Protein is an essential ingredient in fighting against hip dysplasia as well as elbow dysplasia. Vitamin C contributes to healthy eyes and vision which can be useful in preventing cataracts. Omega 3 fatty acids support heart health. A limited amount of fat gives puppies energy while helping them to maintain a normal weight. A puppy should be given 1 to 2 cups of food twice a day. American Coonhound adult dog food: An adult American English Coonhound needs high-quality food with protein in the form of meat like a chicken. Protein in an adult dog’s diet continues to combat conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia. Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids contribute to a healthy coat. Food containing antioxidants helps prevent and fight illness. A limited amount of fat in an adult dog’s diet supplies energy without adding excess weight to its athletic frame. Vitamins A and C support continued eye health in this breed. Adult dogs should receive 2 to 3 cups of food three times per day. Of course, this can be varied if a dog is not as active. Making water available at all times to your adult dog or puppy contributes to their proper digestion.

A weekly grooming routine can help to decrease the amount of hair on the furniture and keep the dog’s coat looking shiny. A grooming glove is helpful in removing dead hair and stirring up natural oils that make a dog’s coat shine. A brush with soft boar’s hair bristles is another helpful grooming tool that smooths this dog’s coat. The best way to groom an American Coonhound is to start at its head and work with the flow of its hair toward its tail. Grooming a dog weekly allows an owner the opportunity to notice skin irritations and bald spots that may be a sign of allergies. In addition, a grooming routine can build even more trust between this dog and its owner. These dogs are intelligent, determined, and fairly easy to put through obedience training. However, they can be distracted by scents of animals and other things in the area. A lot of patience along with words of praise as well as favored treats all combine to help this hound dog learn all its lessons in a training session. American Coonhounds have a lot of energy. They need from 30 to 60 minutes of exercise each day. Exercise contributes to their physical health and mental health. If this dog doesn’t get enough exercise it can start to chew on items in the home and otherwise become destructive. The best exercise for this dog is running. These dogs love to chase down scents and explore their environment. It’s important to ensure they are running in a safe area and are trained to return when called. Also, they like to play fetch and chase! These dogs aren’t appropriate dogs for an apartment dweller. This is a dog that needs a lot of space to move around and stretch its legs.

    "Name": "Redbone Coonhound",
    "Text": "Incredibly vocal, the Redbone Coonhound’s voice can be a sweet tune in areas that won’t be disrupted by their frequent noise. The Redbone Coonhound dates back to colonial days, but it has since made its way into the hearts of many households. With a loud bark and an energetic disposition, it is easy to tell when this breed is around. They won’t need much maintenance, but they crave tons of mental and physical stimulation from their owners. See all of our expert product reviews . As helpful as a few fun facts can be, they don’t tell the entire reality of bringing a Redbone Coonhound home. Here are a few pros and cons to consider before adoption. The Redbone Coonhound was originally brought to the Colonies by Scottish and Irish immigrants. Though the breed itself is American, the Redbone Coonhound is genetically derived from Bloodhounds and Foxhounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Though the stands of the Redbone Coonhound are rather large, the males and females differ slightly. Typically, the male of the breed is larger, standing at 22 to 27 inches tall, measuring from the foot to the shoulder. Females, on the other hand, only measure 21 to 25 inches tall at this same spot. Regardless of gender, the Redbone Coonhound ranges from 45-70 lbs when it has reached adulthood. Anyone who adopts a Redbone Coonhound from a rescue or a breeder will be happy to learn that they are rather healthy animals. Due to their long legs, hip dysplasia is one of the most common issues that they’ll come up against. Luckily, the risk is low, though it can cost up to $6,000 to correct. Always check with breeders that can show a medical history of the parents of the puppy, including ratings from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and the Canine Eye Registry Foundation. See all of our expert product reviews . Others can injure their legs as a result of their energetic jumping and running while hunting. Even coming up against a critter during these escapades can cause a lot of harm. Always lookout for a limp or bite after hunting, no matter how slight, and seek out veterinary care immediately. The floppy ears are a trademark of the Redbone Coonhound, but therein lies another possible health issue: ear infections. Luckily, checking the ears weekly for buildup, mites, and ticks are easy ways to prevent these issues. Since this dog has such an affinity for good flavors and aromas, one of the other concerns is obesity. Feeding a healthy and steady diet to your pup can make a big difference in preventing this problem, though a treat here and it is safe. Putting a dog through genetic testing can answer most potential health questions for their future. Plus, with regular care, the lifespan of the Redbone Coonhound typically ranges from 12-14 years. Overall, you should look out for: The love and adoration that families will get from adopting a Redbone Coonhound are almost immeasurable. They are friendly and sensitive , showing their affection to both adults and children alike. They love the mental and physical stimulation that these interactions bring, though their personality sometimes seems to be driven by the need to not be bored. If they don’t get this feedback, their behavior can take a turn for the worst. Incredibly vocal, their voice can be a sweet tune to take along during hunting season as you trek back with your latest catch. However, since frequent barking is one of their most common traits, it is best to live in an area that won’t be disrupted by their frequent noise. To keep a puppy healthy, the first step is to find a reliable breeder. While rescue dogs are always in need of a home, bringing this pup to a vet and getting genetic testing can give a more precise idea of what to prepare for. Here are a few more ways that you can make your Redbone Coonhound feel more at home. Since the Redbone Coonhound is prone to obesity, careful attention should be paid to their diet. Some owners have success feeding their dog a freeze-dried raw diet. While one feeding a day should be enough, some dogs like to split the food into two meals. Though cottage cheese, cooked eggs, and fresh produce can be appetizing, it should not cover more than 10% of this dog’s diet. Drool may be an issue with the Redbone Coonhound. However, the severity of the drool will depend on the shape of their lips, and you’ll probably notice it the most as they gobble up their water. Most often, this pup will start to drool before a meal or if he smells something particularly appetizing in your home, which is called the “Pavlov reflex.” At A-Z Animals, we think the best dog for Redbone Coonhounds is Diamond Naturals Light Dry Dog Food with Lean Protein. Your dog will drool over this healthy lamb and rice recipe. There’s ample calcium for building and keeping strong bones and cartilage, with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine, clinically proven to help dogs’ joints. They’ll love this food, but since it has complete nutrition and lean protein, your Redbone Coonhound may be less likely to overeat and will turn exercise into lean muscle instead. Try out Diamond Naturals Light Dry Dog Food with Lean Protein, available on Chewy and Amazon. With a short and smooth coat, there’s not much that you’ll have to do to keep Redbone Coonhound groomed. Hounds tend to have their own natural odor, though it won’t bother most owners. Regular bathing can keep this smell under control, but it won’t ever actually go away entirely. The shortness of the coat gives a distinct advantage to owners that don’t like dog hair everywhere because this breed’s shedding is minimal (at its worst). With twice weekly teeth-brushing sessions and weekly ear cleanings, this dog will stay as fresh as can be. The ADD-like demeanor of this dog may conflict directly with all of the training efforts that you put in but make no mistake — this training is necessary. Getting them involved with other dogs and their favorite humans helps to socialize them, giving them the feedback that they need to regulate their energy. This dog craves mental stimulation, which is why many owners will turn training into a game. With enough patience, even the most distracted Redbone Coonhound will be a beloved family pet. Due to the strong build of the Redbone Coonhound, the best way to keep their behavior under control is to get them out the door for some exercise. They like to go on at least one walk or even a jog each day, though they might run off if left alone in a yard for too long. It isn’t that they are disobedient – they just like to run after anything they might hunt. While apartment living might work for this pup, they will need to get outside to exercise properly. When the puppies are under six months old, they’ll need approximately three meals a day. They should not be fed table food to avoid obesity. Though these dogs get big rapidly, their mental and physical development is slightly delayed. Still, as eager as they can be to please owners, any amount of patience in their training will be greatly appreciated by their typically sensitive nature. Redbone Coonhounds have a phenomenal relationship with children. Their innocent and puppy-like demeanor lasts for years longer than other dogs, and they love to play with their younger household members. While supervision with any dog is necessary for little ones, a little training can make this relationship into a bond that lasts for their entire lifespan. These pups are incredibly loyal, and they’ll do anything to keep the strong bond between their child friends alive. As beautiful and wonderful as the Redbone Coonhound can be, it isn’t a good match for everyone. Take a look at these breeds for alternatives to the Redbone Coonhound. These dogs have been included in books for years, though Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls is probably the best place to recall them. Old Dan and Little Ann are title characters, and they even made their way to the big screen when the film adaption premiered in 1974. Walt Disney Productions has even been responsible for introducing the world to a Redbone Coonhound puppy in The Hound That Thought He Was a Raccoon , which came out in 1960. However, the fact that this breed is often seen as a hunting dog may be why there haven’t been any famous celebrity sightings of the Redbone Coonhound outside of the movies.

    "Name": "Treeing Walker Coonhound",
    "Text": "The Treeing Walker Coonhound lets out a long, yodeling call when on the hunt, and a short repeating bark once they “tree” prey. Whining is normal in anticipation of the hunt. Loving and confident, Treeing Walker Coonhounds enjoy spending time with humans. Also known as Walkers, they make good house pets but are work-oriented and require something to keep them busy if they are not going out on hunts. Without an outlet for their energy, Walkers can become restless and destructive. Primarily bred to hunt raccoons , the Treeing Walker Coonhound can hunt on its own or as part of a pack. In addition to raccoons, they track bears , bobcats , and cougars with ease. Walkers are also quick and able to hunt deer in states where it is permitted. See all of our expert product reviews . The name of this breed contains a lot of information about its origins. Treeing Walker Coonhounds are named after a hound dog’s “treeing” technique during hunts, in which it tracks prey by its scent until the animal is forced to run up a tree for safety while the dog waits below and barks loudly until the hunter arrives. These dogs also contain the name of a key family in the development of the breed in the 1700s, who imported and bred hounds from England: Walker. Finally, the last part of their name comes from coonhound dogs who were bred to hunt raccoons and larger game. Originally descended from English and American foxhounds, the Treeing Walker Coonhound is one of the oldest breeds in the U.S. It was developed when a dog called “Tennessee Lead” was crossed with a Walker foxhound in the 1800s. Early on it was classified as an English Coonhound, however, after receiving the name we know it as today, it was recognized as a separate breed by the United Kennel Club in 1945 and by the American Kennel Club in 2012. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The most common coloration found is tri-color, a combination of white, black, and tan. Walkers can also be mostly white with patches of black or tan, or mostly black with white or tan areas. See all of our expert product reviews . The Treeing Walker Coonhound is commonly cross-bred with other hounds, such as the Bluetick Coonhound , resulting in a Bluetick Walker. Another cross-breed resulted in the Beagle , an excellent hunting dog who is also family-oriented. Other non-hunting breeds, such as the Boxer , are crossed with Walkers, resulting in the BT Walker. When crossed with a Poodle , the result is a Treeing Walker Coonoodle. A Walker with a Bulldog results in the English Bull-Walker. The Treeing Walker Coonhound is a medium-sized dog with a sturdy, lean build. He was developed to run effortlessly while pursuing prey and should look the part of an athlete, with weight in proportion to height. The breed is generally healthy, but there are a few issues to be aware of. Like many athletic breeds, Walkers may develop hip dysplasia , one reason why finding a reputable breeder is important. Also, due to their floppy ears, it is easy for moisture and debris to become trapped, leading to ear infections . It is important to check and clean their ears frequently to keep them healthy. Walkers are generally calm, sociable, and loyal. They are typically patient and they enjoy spending time with children. However, when taken for a hunt, Walkers immediately focus and begin casting for scent, using their high energy to become relentless hunters. Walkers are low-maintenance for the most part, they get enough exercise daily. Their affectionate nature makes these dogs a good choice for families with children and other pets. Unlike many hunting breeds, Walkers can quickly learn to leave the family cat alone. Puppies should be fed a high-quality puppy food three times a day. Once they reach six months, Walkers can transition to around two meals a day. While some people choose to eventually move to one feeding a day, breaking the meal into two servings helps reduce boredom and encourages good eating habits. Once your dog reaches around 1 year of age, you should transition to a high-quality adult dog food .

Going over his coat with a brush once a week, along with brushing his teeth every other day, is pretty much all you have to do for this breed. Use a cotton ball or gauze square dampened with a veterinary-recommended ear-cleaning solution to wipe out his ears once a week as well. Finally, clip toenails as often as necessary. While the breed doesn’t require baths often, you may want to wipe off his feet with a damp cloth when bringing him inside during wet weather to avoid any infections and dirt brought into your home. Start doing this from a young age and he will quickly learn to wait at the door and not be bothered by the wiping when he comes inside. Start working with your pup as soon as you bring him home. Walkers can be strong-willed, so introducing short, positive training sessions early on is important to establish good manners. Since the mature hound can reach 70 pounds and has a high energy level, it is important he knows how to behave. Don’t mistake his stubbornness for a lack of intelligence. Like many strong-willed breeds, the Treeing Walker Coonhound will shut down if treated poorly. Use patience, positive reinforcement, and rewards and your pup will be more than happy to please you. Anyone planning on owning a Walker should love the outdoors. These dogs need a minimum of one hour a day of vigorous exercise but the more, the better. Unfortunately, allowing him in the backyard every now and then will not be enough. Instead, plan on walks, jogs, hikes, obedience training, and active play with toys in the backyard. Walkers produce an average of 4 to 6 puppies per litter. When looking for a pup, visit a reputable breeder or adoption agency. Walkers, like many hunting dogs, are frequently available from backyard breeders. Choose a reputable breeder with health certificates verifying proof of vaccination along with any health issues that may present within a litter. Reputable breeders offer a health guarantee on their pups and spend time analyzing bloodlines to ensure the litter has the preferred temperament, lacks genetic predisposition to diseases, and is overall healthy. If you consider adoption, a reputable agency will let you know why a particular dog was surrendered and work with you to find a good match for you. One of the facts that are often overlooked is how wonderful Treeing Walker Coonhounds are with children. They are attentive playmates, aware of their size, and gentle with their movements. This sociable hound may surprise you with an affinity for playing with children, but always supervise interactions between the dog and young children. As patient as this breed is, their floppy ears can become convenient handles for rough play, and their tolerance may encourage rowdy behavior from youngsters.
