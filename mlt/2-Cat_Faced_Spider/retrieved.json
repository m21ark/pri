    "Name": "Common House Spider",
    "Text": "A single common house spider egg sac may contain 400 eggs or more Common house spiders make their webs in the corners and nooks of a home. They are very small creatures measuring less than one-quarter of an inch in length. They live on a diet of flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and ants. Though these spiders have venom , their bite is considered harmless to people and pets. Here are some other common spiders found in homes: Parasteatoda tepidariorum is the scientific name of the common house spider, which is also sometimes called the American house spider. The word Parasteatoda refers to the genus of the spider and the Latin word tepidariorum relates to a warm environment. These spiders take shelter inside warm homes or other structures. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . They belong to the Theridiidae family and the order Araneae. There is one subspecies of the common house spider known as the common gray house spider. There are 10 other types of spiders that fall into the general category of house spiders. These include: Similar to all present-day arthropods, the spiders that inhabit your attic may have originated from marine creatures that were up to 7 feet long and existed 480 million years ago. While true spiders evolved around 300 million years ago, they predate not only humans but also dinosaurs. It is believed that spiders originated approximately 400 million years ago from ancestors that were arachnids with thick waists, and had recently transitioned from aquatic environments. The earliest spiders that can be identified with certainty are arachnids with slender waists, abdominal segmentation, and spinnerets used for producing silk, such as the Attercopus fimbriungus fossils. The common house spider is found in colors ranging from light tan to black. Females are 0.19 to 0.24 inches in length. Males are smaller in size measuring 0.15 to 0.19 inches long. These spiders weigh less than one ounce. One of the features setting male common house spiders apart from females is the orangish-brown coloration on their legs. These spiders have eight spindly legs and eight eyes. Surprisingly, even with so many eyes, they can’t see more than three or four inches in front of them. One of the most interesting things about the common house spider is its body is similar in shape to the black widow spider . They both have bulb-shaped abdomen. But, despite a similar shape, the venom of a black widow spider is far more dangerous. The Giant house spider is the largest type of house spider. The body of a female giant house spider can grow to almost three-quarters of an inch. Furthermore, they have a leg span of 1.8 inches. Their dark colors help common house spiders disappear into the corner of an attic, garage, basement, or spare room in a home. In addition, their coloration can keep them hidden from cats , birds , and dogs that could consume them in one gulp. Though their venom kills small insects, it’s not powerful enough to harm a larger animal. Common house spiders are mostly solitary with one exception. Scientists have observed males and females occupying the same web while they go through the mating process. It’s not unusual to find the webs of two or three common house spiders in the same general space without being right next to one another. This is probably because there is an ample food source in the area. Common house spiders populate every area in the world except for Antarctica. True to their name they live in corners of homes, attics, garages, and garden sheds. When looking for a place to build a web, these spiders choose an area where the air is flowing. A corner of a window where the air is leaking in from outside is a common place to find this spider. A corner in a drafty room or near a pipe that is coming in through an exterior house wall is both favorable places to find this spider’s web. The flow of air increases the chances that a fly, mosquito, flea, or other insect will move through the area. Spiders are carnivores. They are nocturnal so they eat and make repairs to the web at night. Common house spiders are eaten by birds , spider wasps , centipedes , and sometimes domesticated dogs and cats . A common house spider captures flies, mosquitoes, ants, fleas, and other small insects in the sticky strands of its web. When an insect is caught, the spider puts additional silk threads on top of it. This spider bites its prey and injects it with venom to liquefy its organs. It drinks the insides of its prey and consumes any parts that are not too hard to ingest. If you observe a common house spider in your home, look at the area beneath its web. The tiny pieces of debris are the discarded parts of its prey. One common house spider can get rid of a lot of insects in a home. Getting rid of these spiders can mean an increase in pesky flies, mosquitoes, and ants in a home. However, some homeowners object to the webs and the debris beneath the webs left behind by these spiders. There are ways to get rid of common house spiders or discourage them from making webs in your home. One way to discourage these spiders from entering your home is to make it less appealing. Check the insulation around your windows and doors. When you vacuum your carpet, be sure to clean the baseboards too. Use your vacuum cleaner’s extension wand to clean all the corners of the room. A natural repellent is another option. Spray it in various corners to discourage common house spiders from constructing their webs and laying eggs.",

    "Name": "Spider",
    "Text": "Spiders are eight-legged arachnids that live across almost all of Earth aside from Antarctica. As of 2022, there are nearly 50,000 species of spiders living across nearly every major biome. Spiders range from incredibly tiny – the smallest spider is a fraction of the size of a pinhead – to giant spiders that can measure a foot across. What is the scientific name for spiders? The scientific name for spiders is Araneae, and they are air-breathing arthropods with eight legs, fangs that can inject venom, and spinnerets that secrete silk. This group of arachnids is one of the most diverse among all living organisms and can be found on every continent except Antarctica. As of today, 50,356 spider species have been recorded and categorized into 132 families, though there is some debate among scientists about how these should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed. A group of spiders is known as a cluster, clutter, or sometimes a colony. The physical makeup of spiders is distinct from other arthropods in that their typical body parts are combined into two sections, a cephalothorax, and an abdomen, connected by a thin tube-like pedicel. This naming of this structure has been disputed, as there is no fossil or embryonic evidence to suggest that the head and thorax were ever separated. The abdomen of each spider contains the heart and breathing organs. All spiders have eight legs. Many of them have fangs that can excrete a venomous substance. Spiders have silk-spinning organs called spinnerets on their forelegs or under their abdomen. Some spiders have six, two, four, or eight spinnerets that they can move in unison or separately as they so desire. The spinnerets do not only release one thread of silk but are complex and contain many spigots that each release a fine stream of silk. Spiders can also produce different types of silk for different types of projects or combine silks to make them stronger. Some spiders have very large spinnerets consisting of a spigot that stretches the length of their abdomen, such as the desert grass spider. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Spiders use their silk for various purposes, such as building webs to live in, building webs to catch prey, constructing egg sacs, transferring sperm, encapsulating insects, creating balloons to fly, weaving structures to protect themselves from predators, assembling cocoons and manipulating static electricity in the air. Spiders differ from insects in that they do not have antennae. Most spiders have a highly centralized nervous system, meaning that all their ganglia are joined together in the cephalothorax. Additionally, spiders do not use their extensor muscles to extend their limbs but rather rely on hydraulic pressure. Humans have been around for a much shorter period of time than spiders, who likely evolved approximately 400 million years ago. The earliest spiders were likely descended from arachnids that had recently left their aquatic homes. Fossils like Attercopus fimbriungus, which lived 380 million years ago during the Devonian Period, demonstrate that spiders existed long before the dinosaurs. The earliest segmented spider fossils belonged to the Mesothelae group, which had spinnerets positioned in the middle of their abdomens instead of at the end, like modern spiders. It is thought they were predators on the ground, living amongst fern and moss during the Palaeozoic era and hunting primitive creatures like slaters, millipedes, silverfish, and cockroaches. It is possible that these spiders used silk for protection for their eggs, to line a shelter hole, and later for constructing sheet webs and trapdoors. As plants and insects evolved, so did spiders’ use of silk. Spiders with spinnerets on their abdomens (Opisthothelae) emerged over 250 million years ago, which likely encouraged the production of more complex webs to capture prey on the ground and in trees. During the Jurassic Period, when dinosaurs roamed the planet, orb-weaving spiders developed aerial webs to catch the increasing variety of flying insects. Additionally, hunting spiders in different habitats also started to diversify in order to catch more prey and occupy more habitats. The fossil record of spiders is not very extensive. However, amber fossils of spiders, which are complete spiders trapped in tree resin, show us that a spider population similar to today’s existed 30 million years ago. Additionally, segmented spiders have survived in East Asia since the late Palaeozoic period until now. They live in caves and burrows and build trapdoors over them. They have not changed much from their ancestors. There are a variety of habitats where spiders can be found. Most species of spiders prefer living outdoors, where they build webs or hunt for prey on the ground or among vegetation. Common outdoor habitats include forests, fields, gardens, and deserts. Spiders can also live indoors, particularly in areas such as basements and attics that are dark and undisturbed by humans. Additionally, many species of spiders will make their homes near water sources like ponds and streams in order to have easy access to food sources like insects that congregate around bodies of water. Lastly, some aquatic spider species inhabit freshwater rivers and lakes, where they hang out underwater by weaving air bubbles into silken nests from which they breathe oxygen while submerged beneath the surface.

Lastly, some aquatic spider species inhabit freshwater rivers and lakes, where they hang out underwater by weaving air bubbles into silken nests from which they breathe oxygen while submerged beneath the surface. Spiders are carnivores and feed mainly on insects, usually their own prey. Depending on the species, they can also consume other spiders, small mammals, and reptiles. For most of them, however, the main food sources are flying or crawling insects such as flies, moths, and ants. Some spider species will even eat small amphibians or fish if they come across them. The type of diet for a particular spider species depends largely on its size; larger spiders have more options when it comes to potential prey items than smaller ones do. A few types of spiders survive solely by scavenging dead animals or consuming nectar from plants instead of living organisms like insects. In addition to these dietary habits, some spiders use toxins in the form of venom injected into their victims to make them easier to digest before consuming them whole. Spiders are voracious predators, but what animals eat spiders ? With the vast majority of spiders being less than a couple of inches in width, the main answer is that animals that also eat smaller insects will eat spiders as well. Animals like frogs, birds, and lizards are top predators of spiders. In a controlled simulation meant to mimic conditions on an island, researchers tested spider populations with and without lizards. They found that after four days without lizards, 65% of spiders had survived. However, when lizards were introduced, only 40% of spiders remained at the end of the study. This is to say; lizards can deplete spider populations very rapidly. Other animals that eat spiders are fish, snakes, toads, tarantula hawks, scorpions, spider wasps, centipedes, other spiders, bats, and small mammals like shrews. It is also important to know that despite spiders being part of the diet of snakes, there are some species of spiders that eat snakes . Spiders reproduce in a variety of ways, depending on the species. Most spiders lay eggs and store them in silken egg sacs that are either attached to their webs or carried by the female until they hatch. Female spiders can also produce live young without fertilization, though this is more common in some species than others. Once hatched, baby spiders go through several stages of growth before becoming adults. During these stages, called instars, they shed their exoskeleton multiple times as they grow bigger and stronger. After reaching adulthood, most spiders will only live for one or two years before dying off naturally due to old age or predation from other animals. There are a variety of threats that have led to the endangerment of 27 species of spiders. These include habitat loss or fragmentation due to human development, climate change, pollution, and disease. Loss or degradation of their habitats can cause significant population decline for these species as they struggle to survive in a new environment. Pesticides used on crops can also be toxic to spiders, reducing populations and even leading to extinction in some cases. Two examples of endangered spider species are the Regal Jumping Spider (Phidippus regius) and the Hentz Orbweaver (Neoscona crucifera). The Regal Jumping Spider is native to North America and is threatened by the destruction or alteration of its natural habitat due to urban development. The Hentz Orbweaver is found primarily in the southeastern United States and faces similar threats from land-use changes caused by humans, such as deforestation for livestock grazing and urban sprawl. They are covered in thousands of fuzzy blonde hairs. People spin clothing and fishing nets out of these spiders’ silk. Common barn dwelling spider They can grow to be 7 inches long! They typically prey on insects! They seem to move in slow motion. They can go for months without eating! Fast, carnivorous arachnid with a painful bite. Cane spiders don't spin webs to catch prey Female cat-faced spiders die off shortly after laying their egg. They can cling to the side of an aquarium . Males make a rhythmic thrumming like a clock House spiders have the ability to eat most insects in a home. Crab Spiders can mimic ants or bird droppings False spiders actually prey on black widow spiders and other hazardous spiders Fishing spiders have hydrophobic hair on their skin that allows them to survive on water Garden spiders bounce in their webs to confuse predators They are the fastest invertebrates in the U.K. They can run up a tree trunk surprisingly fast. Their fangs aren't big enough to penetrate human skin. The spiderlings look very different than the adults. Some huntsman spiders have an interesting way of moving around. Some cartwheel while others do handsprings or backflips. Shares its name with a Japanese spider demon! Some can jump 50 times the length of their bodies Mexican fireleg tarantulas have bright reddish-orange legs. The female mouse spider is rarely seen because they don't leave their burrows.

    "Name": "Barn Spider",
    "Text": "Barn spiders are a species of spider that is common in North America, specifically in southern parts of Canada and the northeastern United States. They are about ¾ of an inch long and have yellow/brown specks all over their bodies. Like other orb weaver spiders, the barn spider commonly builds a new web every day. The barn spider is most notable for its appearance as Charlotte in the classic children’s book Charlotte’s Web . Scientific name: Araneus cavaticus Scientifically known as Araneus cavaticus, the barn spider was named by a biologist Keyserling in 1882. However, the species was given several other scientific names that were very similar. These include: The species is commonly known as the Hentz orb-weaver after Nicholas Marcellus Hentz, who was the first to collect and classify North American spiders and managed to write down his findings and descriptions of 141 spider species in Boston Society of Natural History’s journal. Barn spiders are yellow or brown in color, with specks on their bodies and stripes on their legs. The stripes vary in color, from dark shades of brown to grey and black. Their undersides are black with white marks on them. Overall, they can have quite a diverse color range, which is why they are commonly mistaken for other species of spiders. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Like most spiders, the barn spider is very small but can still be seen by the naked eye. They’re generally about three-quarters of an inch long, but they can grow up to an inch. On average, male barn spiders are slightly smaller than the females at around ¼ to ½ inch as opposed to ¾ inch. Their bodies have a round shape, with four legs on each side of their body. The legs have a spiny appearance. The spider’s abdomen is hairy and has many bumps on it. Only female barn spiders construct webs. This web is mostly spiral-shaped and flat. There has been little research on the evolution of the barn spider and its origins. Spiders as a whole evolved around 400 million years ago, and arachnids were likely part of the first wave of animals to leave the water and dwell on land. Spiders originally evolved from Chelicerata subphylum which is a branch of Arthropods that includes modern-day animals like sea spiders and scorpions, as well as land spiders and other spider-like creatures. Barn spiders are a nocturnal species of spider, meaning they hunt their prey at night and retract their webs during the day. Then in the evening, the female builds another web to capture prey. The spider sits in the web at night, waiting for insects to get trapped in it. Barn spiders, like all other spiders, prefer to live alone as solitary species. The males are seldom seen unless they want to mate. The females build the web and keep their young close in the beginning. However, nurturing aside, these species live alone for most of their lives. These spiders can also be aggressive towards each other if another spider tries to make a web in the same area as them or tries to inhabit their web. When threatened, barn spiders bounce up and down in their webs to appear intimidating. They also move their web up and down to assert control over it. This unique behavior can also be seen if there is prey in the barn spider’s web and it wants to throw off any leaves or debris off the prey. Once the prey has been caught and consumed, the barn spider retracts its web. As their name suggests, barn spiders live inside or around wooden structures such as barns or sheds. They can also be found in boats or any other wooden corners that provide shelter. Out in the wild, they can be found near cliffs, on trees, or in crevices. So whether in urban areas or not, this spider species can survive. These spiders inhabit many areas of the United States and Canada. Barn spiders are carnivorous creatures that feed on prey that gets stuck in their web at night, between dawn and dusk. They feed on several different types of insects, such as beetles , ants, moths, flies, and mosquitoes. When the spider catches its prey it it injects it with its venom and then sucks out the blood and juices of the insect. Barn spiders are preyed on by any animals that happen to be bigger than them. These include, but are not limited to, birds, lizards , and other spider species that are larger than the barn spider or have poison that could kill the barn spider. Barn spiders are carnivorous, and their diet is largely based on other insects, such as beetles, moths, and ants. They have a poor sense of vision and hunt their prey through vibrations and their webs. Once prey is trapped in their web, barn spiders wrap it in their web’s silk to feed on it. They then inject the prey with a venomous bite. When the prey dies, the spider begins to suck out its blood and juices of it. It covers its prey’s body with digestive fluids so that it disintegrates more quickly. The barn spider recycles its web by eating it. Common predators of the barn spider are birds, lizards, and other larger spider species. Humans also pose a threat to the barn spider since they live typically live in and around man-made structures. Nevertheless, they survive in urban and natural environments, so their population is still stable. Hence their conservation status is of Least Concern. Male barn spiders impregnate one or more females in their lifespan. However, the males will first have to find a mate, which can be a hefty task since the spiders are solitary animals for most of their lives. To make matters a bit easier for the male, the female communicates to the male that she is sexually mature through her dragline, which leaves a trail of pheromones. A dragline is a string of silk dangling from the female’s backside. The males smell these pheromones and use the trails to attempt to find the female. Once the male has located a female, he fights any other males that might be hovering around the female to mate. Whichever male emerges victorious gets to mate with the female. But before doing so, the male needs to signal to the female that he belongs to the same species as her and wishes to mate. He does so by attaching a thread to the female’s web and sending out specific vibrations as a form of signal for mating. If the female recognizes the male spider as the same species, the female then positions herself for sex. Then the male deposits the sperm in the female’s genital opening. The female stores these sperm near her ovaries, and fertilization occurs when she is ready to lay eggs about a month later. A female barn spider can lay around a hundred eggs at once. The babies of a barn spider are known as barn spiderlings. Until hatching, the mother keeps the eggs safe from predation by wrapping them up in silk in an egg sac. There is little known about barn spiderlings, except that they become independent very soon after hatching. On average, barn spiders can live for about a year. And during their lives, they face some common diseases as they age. These include: The exact number of barn spiders all over the world is unknown. However, their conservation status is Least Concern as of yet, owing to their adaptability to urbanization.",

    "Name": "Black Widow Spider",
    "Text": "Their reputations are fierce, but in reality, black widow spiders — aka Latrodectus — are calm, loner pacifists that only unleash venomous bites when they’ve exhausted all other defensive options. Thirty-two species of the infamous arachnids populate the Earth on every continent except Antarctica , and the genus probably popped onto the world scene about 300 million years ago. Female black widows carry large loads of venom, but males don’t. And though it’s widely believed that all females eat their mates after breeding, such behavior is rare and only happens in lab environments where there’s no escape. You can check out more incredible facts about black widow spiders . Latrodectus is the scientific name for widow spiders. A portmanteau combining the New Latin word “latro,” meaning “bandit,” and the Ancient Greek word “dēktēs,” meaning “biter,” it was coined by French nobleman Baron Charles Athanase Walckenaer in the early 1800s. Colloquially, the name translates to “bandit who bites.” There are 34 recognized species in the “true widow” genus. In North America , three species — Latrodectus mactans, Latrodectus hesperus, and Latrodectus variolus — are informally known as southern black widows, western black widows, and northern black widows, respectively. Latrodectus tredecimguttatus is the European black widow; Latrodectus hasseltii crawls throughout Australia and known as the redback black widow; in South America , two species — Latrodectus corallinus and Latrodectus curacaviensis — are commonly called South American black widow spiders. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Black widows are Araneomorphae a category of spiders known for having chelicerae which cross each other. Within that vast collective, they also belong to the subgroup Theridiidae, which are also referred to as tangle-web spiders, known for their habit of spinning adhesive webs for the capture of prey and the bristles on the seventh segment of their back legs, known as the tarsus. As members of the genus Latrodectus, they are known as true widows and are connected to their European and South American counterparts, brown widows, red widows, the Australian redback spider, etc. These arachnids also share the ability to produce the neurotoxic venom known as latrotoxin, known to be especially potent and which in turn gives rise to latrodectism. Nearly all black widow spiders are about 1.5 inches long, weigh approximately 0.035 ounces, and have dark-colored, hourglass-shaped bodies accented with white, brown, or red markings. Like most web-weaving spiders, widows have terrible eyesight and rely on vibrations to sense prey and danger. Unlike the Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) , the world’s largest spider, black widows are tiny — about the size of a paperclip. But don’t let their compact bodies fool you — because widows pack dangerous loads! Their bites release a neurotoxin called latrotoxin, which can cause extreme pain, muscle rigidity, vomiting, and heavy sweating. People bitten by black widow spiders may experience these symptoms for up to a week. But it’s false that widow bites routinely result in human fatalities. They do, however, kill cats and dogs . Only females are harmful; males do not possess sufficient quantities of venom to cause signficant damage. Widow spiders are notorious for female sexual cannibalism — meaning the ladies eat males after mating. But what people may not understand is that it doesn’t happen all that often, and not all species engage in the practice. So why do some Latrodectus ladies murder their mates? Nobody knows for sure, but a popular theory postulates that the act increases the odds of offspring survival. Additionally, thanks to special chemicals that emanate from webs after meals, males can sense when females are well-fed, and most don’t choose hungry mates. In fact, most males who fall prey to their partners are trapped in a laboratory environment and can’t escape. Widow spiders crawl around every continent except Antarctica . They’re particularly abundant in North America , especially in Canada’s wine country, the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. Typically, black widow spiders spin webs near the ground or in dark, low places. Inside, you’ll most likely find them in dark corners under desks, basements, and attics. Outside, they hunker in holes and wood piles. What do black widow spiders eat? They prey on small insects like flies , mosquitoes, grasshoppers , beetles , and caterpillars . Within their environment, you would consider them an apex predator. How do black widows catch food? Like most other spider species, black widows weave sticky webs of silken fibers. When waiting for food to stumble into their lairs, widow spiders hang upside in the middle of their nets. When a victim crashes in, they’re incapacitated by the web’s stickiness. At that point, the spider converges, paralyzes the prey with venom, and then wraps its meal in silk to further prevent escape. When a black widow is ready to dine, it covers its prey in erosive digestive juices and slurps up the remains. If a widow senses danger, it will quickly crawl down a loose web thread and scurry to safety. Few animals prey on black widow spiders because of the insects ’ body shapes and markings, which scientists believe send unpleasant signals that repel most animals. But rules come with exceptions, and in this case, the three are praying mantises (Mantodea) , alligator lizards (Anguidae) , and blue mud wasps (Chalybion californicum), which use their stingers to paralyze before chowing down. Humans also pose a threat to black widow spiders because we accidentally crush them and purposefully kill them when stumbling upon the species at home. Widow spiders are solitary animals that only come together in late spring for mating season. During the yearly ritual, males and females partner up, and the former injects the latter with sperm. The ladies then fertilize their eggs internally and lay silken egg sacs. The sac incubates for about 30 days, at which point a pod of self-sufficient spiderlings hatch. The moment they’re born, baby spiders scurry away from the nest. The wind often helps them along, and most find themselves far away from home within hours of birth. But a black widow’s life isn’t long. Many die before they reach a month old, and few — mostly females — make it to three years old. Black widow spiders aren’t in danger currently. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature doesn’t even include the animal on its Red List . IUCN does list false widow spiders, but only under the Data Deficient section. Black widow spiders live in hundreds of exhibits and labs around the world. Here’s a partial list of U.S. zoos that care for individuals from the genus:",

    "Name": "Jumping Spider",
    "Text": "“The jumping spider is known as the ‘cute spider’.” Members of the largest spider family, jumping spiders , are diurnal and love to hunt in the sunshine. Unusually pretty for arachnids, they come in a rainbow of colors, though even the biggest one, Hyllus giganteus , is small. More than just a pretty face, the spider hunts insect pests in the worst way; it carefully stalks then jumps on them to deliver a killing, venomous bite. Here are more facts about this amazing little spider. The jumping spider belongs to the Salticidae family. The name comes from the Latin word saltus , which means “jump.” There are 600 genera in this family and over 6,000 species, some with subspecies. Genus names include: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Humans have evolved to find big eyes and round faces cute. This helps humans to survive and help nurture offspring. While jumping spiders are, in fact, super cute, they did not evolve to be cute for people. Jumping spiders are so cute they have even made their way into pop culture in animated shorts. Their large forward-facing eyes and fuzzy bodies may be adorable, but their purpose is for hunting and camouflage. In fact, salticid spiders have developed excellent vision that supports a diverse range of visually-mediated behaviors. They have different body shapes and colors, and some even resemble ants or beetles. They use various techniques to catch prey, such as stalking, web-making, and ambushing, and some specialize in catching specific types of prey. Furthermore, mating displays are both visual and vibrational, and some species engage in male-male agonistic displays. Like many spiders, females tend to attack and sometimes kill their male counterparts if the courting does not go just right. In fact, videos and other documented footage can be found of this very common jumping spider behavior. Identification of jumping spiders from other types of spiders is rather easy. Their heads, unlike those of other spiders, can be said to have faces, as the surfaces are flat and their anterior median eyes or AME are huge, close together, and front-facing. The amazing facts about their eyes are that they give the spider excellent, three-dimensional vision and allow it to find and leap on prey with accuracy. The eyes also make some people regard them as cute, a word seldom used to describe other spiders. Six smaller eyes form a sort of horseshoe around the AME. Like all spiders, jumping spiders have eight legs. The front pair is larger than the back legs, and they are held somewhat like the legs of crab spiders . However, the identification of crab spiders can be told because their eyes are nothing like the eyes of jumping spiders. The jumping spiders’ front legs are meant to grab their prey, but their smaller hind legs provide the power to jump. Jumping spiders also come in vivid colors, from the translucent jade green of Onomastus kinoi to the brilliant colors of the well-named peacock jumping spider to the pretty spots and stripes and metallic blue mouthparts of the bold jumper. Some of these spiders can even change the colors of their eyes. Identification of jumping spiders from each other is more challenging, as many look so much alike that they can only be told apart by microscopic analysis. Jumping spiders are diurnal, and they’re known for their irregular and somewhat jerky movements as they walk. They don’t spin webs, but as they move from place to place they lay down a dragline of silk, so they can pull themselves up if they jump and miss. The jumping spider also uses their silk to build nests where it can sleep, molt, make egg cases, and protect itself from inclement weather. It can be said that these spiders live just about anywhere where they can find prey and shelter. Indeed, the highest living animal in the world is Euophrys omnisuperstes , a jumping spider that lives on Mount Everest at an elevation of about 22,000 feet. The very name of this tiny spider means “standing above everything.” The great majority of jumping spiders are carnivores and mostly prey on insects. They have powerful venom that’s often enough to paralyze prey several times larger than they are . Some, such as the regal jumper, are big enough to take baby geckos and iguanas . Yet some of these spiders sip nectar, and the beautiful Bagheera kiplingi is largely vegetarian and eats nutrient-rich Beltian bodies from a type of mimosa tree. Once in a while, it will steal a larva from an ant that guards the tree or eat another B. kiplingi spider. Other spiders, such as Portia , are specialists in eating other spiders. A Portia spider will lower itself on a strand of silk into another spider’s web. It will then cause the web to vibrate as if it’s caught prey, and when the owner comes to investigate, Portia jumps. Ant specialists have evolved to resemble the ants themselves, the better to hunt them. Other spiders will steal prey caught in another spider’s web. As small arachnids, jumpers are part of the diet of a variety of predators. As previously mentioned, they will eat each other. They are in turn eaten by other families of spiders such as wolf spiders . Other creatures that have jumping spiders on the menu are birds , frogs , toads , and lizards . Spider wasps paralyze spiders, drag them to their nests, and use them as food for their larvae. These arachnids usually mate during the spring and summer. Their mating rituals have fascinated scientists and onlookers for years. Male jumping spiders sometimes have spectacular iridescent colors with which to woo females. They often perform a dance where they wave and vibrate their legs, zigzag, or even “sing.” Even male spiders whose coloration looks dull to the human eye might be fluorescent to a female of the same species. If the female is interested, she’ll crouch, or even collapse. Some go belly up. The male is then allowed to climb on top of her and mate. The female jumping spider might carry the fertilized eggs inside them for a couple of weeks before they go to a secluded place and lay their eggs in an egg case woven of silk. She’ll take care of the egg case and then care for the spiderlings they are independent. Some females die soon after this. There is one spider that nurses its babies with what can only be called milk. This species is the ant mimics Toxeus magnus . This spider nurses her babies, especially her daughters, for as long as 38 days after they hatch. The population of jumping spiders is easily in the billions. There are 6,000 species of this spider, and they thrive in a variety of habitats on Earth.",

    "Name": "Writing Spider",
    "Text": "“Writing spiders can pluck webs like guitar strings to communicate with a mate. Almost like, they are playing songs to get their attention. “ The writing spider is a mostly passive carnivorous pest that is as shy as it is small. It feasts on smaller pests like Aphids, flies , mosquitos , and gnats. While their bite is similar to that of a bee sting, it can be dangerous for individuals with a weaker immune system. Writing spiders is one of 88 species of Argiope spiders that include the Argiope bruennichi and the Argiope anasuja . The common factor that lies throughout the genus of these spiders is the markings that they have on their abdomen. These spiders exist throughout multiple countries across the world and are especially prevalent in most tropical countries. Writing spiders, also known as garden spiders, belong to the Araneidae family, which spin these unique orb webs. There are more than 3,000 species of Araneidae in various countries, as they come in a variety of sizes and patterns. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Here are a few: Female spiders keep a single web in places where they are less likely to move, mainly due to their poor vision. They are easily recognizable thanks to their yellow and black markings throughout the lower abdomen. The spider earns its name “writing spider” due to its unique behavior of weaving a zig-zag pattern in the center of its web, serving to stabilize the expansive structure, while also employing web vibrations as a defense mechanism when disturbed. According to the old myth surrounding writing spiders, if someone disrupts or damages the web of a writing spider, it is believed that the spider will reweave the web and inscribe the person’s name. The superstition suggests that the individual whose name is written will meet their demise before sundown the following day. The Argiope aurantia, commonly known as the yellow garden spider, is found in Central and North America, with its highest concentration in the eastern part of its range. They can be seen in various habitats like near water bodies, grassy hillsides, and woodlands. The spider is often spotted in areas affected by human activities, such as roadsides, farms, and gardens. Writing spiders tend to stand out when compared to others even in their genus. Their yellow and black markings instantly stand out, providing visual clues for their distinct appearance. On the other hand, they also spin unique zigzag webs, which is also one of their recognizable characteristics. Writing Spiders rarely leave their webs, spinning one in a place where they will experience the least disturbance. Due to their weak eyesight, they rely on their sensitive touch and changes in air pressure to “see.” Even male spiders make their presence to female spiders known by strumming their webs to create specific vibrations. The female yellow garden spiders can be as big as 1.2 inches, while male spiders are usually less than 0.6 centimeters in size. Female spiders will also have the characteristic yellow bands and silver-looking hairs on their body. The wasp spider also looks very similar to the writing spiders, with the main difference being that the former has black and yellow stripes running horizontally throughout the body. This species of spider can be very passive and only really attack when provoked. Similar to common house spiders , writing spiders can make their webs in various corners of a home. They can be very shy and rarely ever seek out people to harm. Therefore, they can usually co-exist with humans , as long as no one touches their web. Other common places where you can find these spiders include bushes, shrubs, and gardens, where they find most of their prey. These spiders usually exist in woodlands, grassy hillsides, and near bodies of water. They are also very popular in places where two distinct habitats meet, specifically, those that they feast on. These types of unique habitats prove to be very beneficial, as they rarely have to leave. Writing spiders can have many predators out in the wild. Some can include spider wasps and shrews along with lizards and birds . Humans can also be predators of these writing spiders, even if they do not consume them after. Unlike hunting spiders like the wolf spider , writing spiders spend most of their time on their webs. They do not go out and hunt for food it instead comes to them. Female spiders will even consume their mates after reproducing. Writing spiders and humans can peacefully coexist, especially since they usually build their webs where you go the least. But if you wish that they would leave your house, you can easily get them out by removing their source of food. The food you eat can usually attract insects like ants or flies , which can attract these spiders. Keeping your house clean and getting rid of food residue can be a good way to ensure they stay away from your home. You can also peacefully relocate the spider by trapping them in a jar and releasing them in some bushes. Another good way to relocate them is by tearing down their web once or twice. If they feel like they are not safe in a specific location, they will move. Peppermint spray can be an effective deterrent as well. Writing spiders mostly reside in shrubbery and gardens, where they can catch plenty of prey. However, their choice of habitat can also put them in proximity to their predators. Juvenile writing spiders usually fall prey to jumping spiders and bigger garden spiders fall prey to spider wasps . Interestingly, jumping spiders can also fall prey to bigger writing spiders when trapped in their web. Birds are also a common threat to these spiders, as they can easily pick out the spiders from the shrubbery. Mating between writing spiders is usually quick, as the male spider plucks the web of a female spider to get her attention. The male also attaches a web to a separate surface, so that it can make a quick escape if the female tries to attack. If the female accepts the mate, the male will have an uncontrollable seizure after copulation. The male dies shortly after and the female later consumes him. Female writing spiders will usually mate in the spring or in the fall, which is also when they create a sac for their eggs. They are capable of producing up to 1,400 eggs with a single mate, which will usually hatch in 60 to 90 days. If the female is mated in spring, the eggs will hatch in the summer, but if she is mated in fall, the spiders will continue to nestle in the sac until spring comes. Male writing spiders rarely ever live for more than a few months. Since they mate when they die, they rarely live long. On the other hand, female garden spiders can survive for many years if they mate in the spring. But if they mate in the fall, they usually die during the first major frost of the season. The population of this writing spider is currently stable, and they are abundant throughout the US, Canada, and Mexico. According to the National Wildlife Federation , these spiders are widespread and their populations are stable.",

    "Name": "Garden Spider",
    "Text": "Known for their distinctive radial-style webs, garden spiders are a common sight throughout much of Europe and North America . They live in various habitats, although you can usually find their large webs in and around gardens, hence their name. Despite their imposing size, they are not overly aggressive or dangerous to humans. In fact, many people consider them beneficial because they often prey on pests. The term garden spider can refer to many different species of spider in the family Araneidae, or orb weaver spiders. The family includes over 3,067 species in 177 genera, making it the third-largest spider family in the world. That said, when people talk about garden spiders, they are usually referring to the common garden spider, also known as the European garden spider, Araneus diadematus. In addition to simply the garden spider, it goes by several other names, including the diadem spider, cross spider, crowned orb weaver, and pumpkin spider. Its scientific name derives from the Greek and Latin words diadema, meaning “crown,” and atus, meaning “like.” While most people mean Araneus diadematus when they refer to garden spiders, numerous other spiders have similar names. They include: Garden spiders display sexual dimorphism, with females measuring larger than males. Females range in length between 6.5 and 20 millimeters, while males vary from 5.5 to 13 millimeters long. Depending on the specimen, they come in a range of colors, including dark gray, light yellow, orangish-red, and dark brown. That said, all garden spiders feature characteristic white markings across the dorsal side of the abdomen. These markings form the shape of a cross similar to a fleur de lis, hence the reason behind one of its common names, the cross spider. The abdomen appears quite bulbous and sports a covering of tiny hairs. Meanwhile, longer hairs cover the cephalothorax. Like all spiders, they possess eight legs, four to each side, which are covered in spiky hairs. Originally hailing from Europe, you can now find garden spiders throughout North America. They typically live in grasslands , parks, and gardens, hence their name. They require access to moisture and plenty of sites that they can use to attach their webs. Common sites for their webs include trees, bushes, shrubs, and flowers. However, they will also readily make use of human structures such as doorways, windows, or posts. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Garden spiders construct distinctive radial-style webs perpendicular to the ground. The first web they construct almost always looks nearly perfect but doesn’t remain so for long. At the end of each day, they deconstruct, roll up, and consume the silk so they can recycle the protein and make new silk. The average web contains between 25 and 30 radial threads consisting of regular angles between 12 and 15 degrees. Typically, the webs of younger spiders feature more radii than the webs of older spiders. At their largest, garden spider webs can measure nearly 20 centimeters in diameter. Like all spiders, garden spiders are carnivores that prey on insects and other invertebrates. They prey primarily on flying insects that stumble into their webs, such as flies , moths , mosquitos , and beetles . In addition, females may cannibalize males either before or after mating. Garden spiders possess poor eyesight, so they must rely on other senses to hunt for food. To catch their prey, they wait near the edges of their webs or in a silken retreat. They monitor their web by holding onto a signal thread with one of the claws on their feet. If they sense any vibrations, they will rush forward to inject their unfortunate prey with paralyzing venom. This venom serves a dual purpose: it helps to sedate their meal and protect the spiders from potential injury. With their prey paralyzed, garden spiders then set about wrapping up their meal with silk. Depending on how much prey is readily available, they may consume their food immediately or save it for later. For the most part, garden spiders aren’t something you want to worry about getting rid of. As their name implies, they mostly build their webs outdoors in gardens, parks, and fields. They rarely make their way inside homes, which reduces the need to remove them. In addition, many people consider them beneficial because they prey on garden pests. However, if you decide you want to get rid of garden spiders, there are a few things you can do. First, minimize places for them to hide or build their webs. Next, down any spider webs that you come across. Finally, if you’re really serious, you use insecticides to kill off their food sources.",

    "Name": "Orange Spider",
    "Text": "“ Orange spiders make vertically oriented webs for catching prey .” The marbled orb weaver , popularly known as the orange spider, looks like a pumpkin with legs, thanks to a distinct orange color and inflated abdomen. It is one of the most common garden spiders in North America. The species makes vertically oriented webs on trees, shrubs, and grasses. Araneus marmoreus is a predator with a potent venom for paralyzing prey but rarely attacks humans. There are several distinct, orange-colored garden spiders. However, the most common orange spider is the marbled orb weaver — Araneus marmoreus . The species is also sometimes referred to as a pumpkin spider because it has an inflated abdomen and a vibrant yellow color. The marbled orb weaver belongs to the Araneidae family. This is the third largest spider family, with 3,108 species in 186 genera worldwide. Members of this family are known for their circular wheel-shaped webs that they make in forested areas, fields, and gardens. There are two main varieties of marbled orb-weaver spiders in the world. The most popular one is the orange spider with an inflated orange abdomen and black or brown marbling. The second variety is the pyramidatus . This spider has a paler orange color and may sometimes be white. Instead of marbling, it has a single patch on its abdomen. Both varieties are rarely seen in the same location, with the pyramidatus being more common in Europe, while the Araneus marmoreus is more common in North America. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The most prominent part of this spider’s appearance is the yellowish orange inflated, pumpkin-like abdomen. Some can be dark orange, and others can be plain yellow. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is one of the most brightly colored, attractive spiders in the world. As with most spider species, females are usually two to three times bigger than males and have the most striking appearance. Size measurements for females vary between 0.35 and 0.7 inches in length and 0.09 and 0.18 inches in width. Males, on the other hand, are between 0.35 and 0.39 inches long, with a width of 0.09 to 0.1 inches. Orange spiders are known for their large, inflated abdomen. The most common form of this spider has an orange abdomen with black or brown markings. However, the color and patterns may vary slightly from one individual to the other. They have a yellow-to-burnt-orange cephalothorax with dark lines on either side. Their legs are usually bright red with a black and white banding towards the end. In some varieties, the legs have light brown bands instead. The orange spider has distinct black eyes, which tend to be quite sharp. The spider has a very short lifespan of seven to eight months. Both males and females tend to die after reproduction. The orange spider is non-aggressive and flees from the first sign of threat or trouble. It is mostly solitary until it finds a mate and goes into reproduction. They typically like to spin their webs in the morning and wait for prey at night. Araneus marmoreus is found in several regions across continental America, eastern Britain, as well as East and Central Europe. It has not been found in northern Ireland yet. It lives in woodlands and spins its web in tall herbaceous vegetation, shrubs, and the lower branches of trees. Orange spiders also inhabit the Nearctic and Palearctic regions, the Gulf Coast, and the Holarctic regions. Within these areas, you will find them in forests, meadows, agricultural fields, peat bogs, and rivers. They can also be found in man-made places like mailboxes but rarely venture indoors. The name “orb-weaver spider” is a reference to the unique shape of this spider’s web, which is similar to a wheel. Orange spiders make webs with supporting lines as the main framework. Silk threads attached to the main supporting lines radiate out from the center of the web like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. They may also add some zig-zag patterns to the web. When prey lands in the web, it vibrates to alert the spider. Generally, spiders began their evolutionary journey about 400 million years ago during the Devonian. That’s more than 150 million years before the first dinosaurs arrived on the scene. Scientists believe that the earliest arachnids had a semi-aquatic lifestyle before coming on land fully. The ancestors of present-day spiders were not thin-waisted like today’s varieties. They also had abdominal segmentations, which are absent in modern spiders. The first true spiders with spinnerets emerged about 380 million years ago. Members of the Mesothelae group (which represents the oldest group of spiders) had their silk-producing organs in the middle of their abdomen instead of at the end like modern day spiders. These spiders were mainly ground-dwelling and lived on the forest floor of the Paleozoic Era. Their diet included other primitive arthropods like cockroaches, millipedes, and silverfish. Primitive spiders produced silk, but it was mainly an adaptation for protecting their egg and lining their burrows. Later on, they developed the ability to build trapdoors for catching prey. The use of two-dimensional and three-dimensional webs is one of the most noteworthy adaptations that spiders developed. Scientists think they developed this adaptation as plant and insect life diversified. The development of spinnerets at the end of their body about 250 million years ago allowed the spiders to build more elaborate sheet-like webs for capturing prey on the ground and in trees. By the Jurassic Period (about 191 to 136 million years ago), flying insects became more abundant. Orb-weaving spiders like the orange spider developed the ability to make sophisticated aerial webs for catching these insects. Scientists are not sure which came first, the horizontally oriented 3D web builders, such as the tent-web spiders, or the 2D web builders, like the orange spider. Araneus marmoreus is predominantly insectivorous. They feed on insects that they catch in their intricate webbing. Since they are orb-weaving spiders, orange spiders are adept at crafting masterful webs using silky and non-silky strands that wrap around prey as tightly as possible. The web vibrates when it hooks a prey. This alerts the spider to attack and paralyze its prey with venom. Orange spiders then inject digestive fluids into the insects to soften the meat before they start eating. They can catch up to 14 insects in one day using this technique. Some of the insects that make up this spider’s diet include beetles, wasps , moths, and mosquitoes. Large arthropods such as scorpions, centipedes, and wasps prey on spiders. Birds and certain reptiles also feed on them. Orange spiders are not harmful to humans. They are aggressive, but their venom is only potent against prey animals. On a human, their venom is not any more dangerous than a bee or wasp sting. They also don’t come into homes, so encounters with humans are few and far between. Aside from the marbled orb weaver, other spiders may also be referred to as orange spiders due to their vibrant orange colors. They include:",

    "Name": "Grass Spider",
    "Text": "Grass spiders are often found mainly in the grass, as you can determine by their name. But they might wander off to other places. They are one of the 1,200 funnel-web spider species that create a blackhole-shaped webs through their large spinnerets. You will often find these webs more than you will find the grass spider. Grass spiders are known as the Agelenopsis by scientists. It was first described in 1869 and is Greek in origin. The term Agelenopsis consists of “ Agelena” , which is a genus also known as Eurasian grass spiders, and “opsis” , which means “to look like”. It belongs to the family Agelenidae and the order Araneae. It is often confused with the wolf spider and the hobo spider, because of the patterns on its head region. You will spot on either side of the midline two black lines that are slightly lighter and thinner than those on a wolf spider. Moreover, the abdomen of the grass spider has a series of dark chevrons, which are lighter than on wolf spiders. The grass spider contains venom, but with such small fangs, they are not dangerous to humans. The grass spider has a few common names around the world. They are funnel web spiders, ground spiders, sheet web spiders, and funnel weavers. There are 14 known species of grass spiders. They are: The eggs are in form of a sac that is laid by the female during the spring season. But the female grass spider dies shortly after hatching the eggs because of the drop in temperature. The baby spiders hatch after a while and go through eating, mating, and molting to eventually become adult spiders. Grass spiders are about half an inch or three-quarters of an inch long. They exhibit sexual dimorphism, and the females are larger than the males. The females measure up to 0.39 to 0.78 inches while the males are around 0.31 to 0.70 inches long. They weigh just as much as a jumping spider , approximately 3 ounces. It has a hard shell or carapace that is round in shape and has three distinct bands. Two of them run on either side of the middle band and are darkish brown in color. The middle band, however, is slightly lighter than the other two. The grass spider is usually yellowish brown in color with chevron patterns that distinguish them from other similar spiders. But they show a mix of different colors on their body. The carapace is yellowish brown in color while the abdomen and the distinct part of the legs are relatively darker in color. The spinnerets are long structures on their abdomen but appear as short tails on the body. The grass spider’s webs often identify it, rather than its physical appearance. You will find its web placed horizontally and formed as a sheet-like structure ending in a funnel. You can imagine it to resemble a black hole. The sheet extends up to 3 feet, while the funnel may measure up to a foot long. The funnel portion of the web sits within a shelter that often leads down to the spider’s safe space. This may be a rock or any crevice. Prey may come on this web that sends the signal to the Grass Spider. This trap allows the Grass Spider to pounce on them. The web is not that reliable for the spider, because it is not exceptionally sticky. Because of the shape, the prey falls inside the trap. This is why grass spiders are agile. They speed toward their prey and attack them, rather than waiting for the prey to stick to the web. A grass spider is solitary in nature. You will not find it interacting with other of its species socially unless it is the mating season. But one grass spider may share its habitat with other grass spiders sometimes. Their behavior is mostly nocturnal where they avoid going out to hunt in the daylight to hide from predators. They will hunt and eat their prey at night. Grass spiders mainly reside in North America. But they were introduced into various countries in Central Asia . Their population size is unknown, but they are in abundance in the northern parts of America. If you wish to spot them, you can find them in dirty places in a house. They are not attracted to grime, but this is where their prey resides. Many small insects like ants are usually near food scraps or other dirty areas. Hence, these sites make as good as any place for the grass spiders to come and set up their webs. However, this is only a rare instance where a male grass spider may find itself in homes. Otherwise, they are found in lawns, grass, gardens, ornamental plants and trees, along foundations, log piles, under rocks and lawn ornaments, tubs, window wells, and sinks. They tend to hide inside the funnel portion and come out only when there is prey nearby on their web. Grass spiders are carnivorous in nature and more specifically, insectivorous. They are pretty fast in locomoting, which serves as a great hunting technique for the Grass Spiders. They eat insects that are smaller than them. This includes insects found in the grass, like moths, crickets, grass bugs, aphids, grasshoppers , etc., or the ones found inside homes like ants. Their predators include lizards , birds, and centipedes. Grass Spiders are not particularly dangerous to humans. They carry venom, but that is mostly for their prey. Moreover, they are very shy and not at all aggressive in nature. They may bite a human but only in self-defense or if provoked. Reported grass spider bites have caused pain, swelling, redness, and itching. These symptoms usually stay with the victim for a time ranging anywhere between one day and ten days. Sometimes, a bacterial infection may occur. There have been no reports of a fatal grass spider bite. Having said that, they may sometimes inhabit domestic homes. You might only find them due to their webs because they stay hidden in the funnel portion of the web that is situated within a shelter. But if you have small insects, you may find yourself encountering a grass spider infestation too. If that happens, you can opt to do a few things. Enjoying our spider-related articles?

    "Name": "Hobo Spider",
    "Text": "The Hobo Spider is a kind of spider that designs funnel webs and often travels from city to city. Hence, its name became Hobo Spider. Like its traveling preferences, its genus was also changed quite a few times. It was considered to be a flesh-eating insect in the olden days but after research, scientists have fallen into a debate on whether it is a harmful spider or not. Although it has been identified numerous times, its physical description is quite hard to decode because spiders often vary in their appearances. The Hobo Spider (Eratigena agrestis) belongs to the Family Agelenidae and comes from the order Araneae. Formerly, it was regarded as the Tegenaria agrestis; before that, it was in the Genus Aranea because of its likeness to the European habitat. But in 2013, the Genus for the Hobo Spider was finally have been thought to be Eratigena . The Hobo Spider is also commonly known as the funnel web spider. But it is not the same as the Australian funnel web spider, more commonly referred to as the funnel web spider. The exact population size of the Hobo Spiders is unknown. However, in a study conducted on these spiders, there was an estimate found. The Utah Plant Pest Diagnostic Lab has been keeping track of the number of Hobo Spiders since the late 70s. Out of the 13,500 samples that have been submitted in a specific time, 639 of them were Hobo Spiders. So, it may be a stretch to think there are only 639 of the Hobo Spiders that exist. But in a sample of insects and mites, the Hobo Spiders are within the range of 4 to 6% which itself is a significant number in the spider population. As for its species, only one has been discovered until now. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . As mentioned before, it is hard to identify spiders from a distance. They do have distinctive features but are visible only if you see them through a microscope. Secondly, these physical attributes are better understood by an arachnologist. They are usually brown in color but may range from light to dark brown among various Hobo Spiders. A dark center line is seen running down vertical of the body to the center along with lighter stripes running on both ends of the body. You will also find yellow markings on the body but that is quite general with many spiders and they vary in color quite often. They are called chevrons and are pointed towards the head in a V shape. However, these markings are not quite visible to the naked eye and if you do spot a Hobo Spider with such a distinctive feature, there are more chances of it being a juvenile Hobo Spider. The Hobo Spider is oblong-shaped and has a segregated thorax and an abdomen. At the near end, you will find two spinnerets but there is no antenna on the body. It measures about one-fourth of an inch and sometimes one-half inch in length. However, it is to note that the male adults are shorter than the female adults. The spider has long and slender legs attached to the upper body region or thorax. They are 8 in number and do not have any bands on them. They can run pretty quickly but are unable to climb on walls or other such surfaces. You will find them usually hidden in their webs which are either tube-shaped or funnel-like. Hence, the reason they are also called funnel web spiders. These are all general features that may also be found in other kinds of spiders. This is why to be sure about their identification, you will need to be on the search for the following attributes that are only visible under a microscope. Their behavior is mainly solitary. They live in isolation on their webs or in hiding. But they won’t come charging at you in the form of groups like you usually see in movies. They are only found together when they are mating. Their ground for mating is the web that the adult Hobo Spiders built for themselves. The females wait for the males to arrive at this mating ground. Once it is done, the male goes away but eventually dies. The Hobo Spiders are usually found in America, European countries, Canada , and Mexico. They usually prefer the warmer climate. When it is the cold season, you can either find them hidden somewhere warm or in people’s houses. If you were to be specific, then you would find them in places that contain crevices, holes, or cracks that would allow the formation of their webs. Their legs may not help them much in climbing but they do work well on uneven surfaces like clothing, carpets, stairs, and such. Like a funnel, they design their webs and allow their prey to slowly fall into their twisted trap. You can find them in the months of August till October hidden with fellow Hobo Spiders to mate. This is when the two genders mate but only one comes out alive near the end. The male dies while the female lives on to lay eggs. Another thing that is quite interesting about these Spiders is that they might be considered aggressive by some people. However, they might be of that nature mostly due to defense. A Hobo Spider has a very simple way of hunting. Its web is the main element in its intent to kill. Whenever a prey is trapped in the web, a vibration runs through the web alerting the Hobo Spider of its meal for the day. This technique is more towards surviving rather than hunting with the predator sense. The main insects trapped in the web are ground insects like flies, ants , and cockroaches. They will gobble up anything that sets foot into their tunnel-shaped web. This is why they live in survival mode. Its predators include the Praying Mantis (Mantis religiosa) and the Yellow-legged Mud-Dauber Wasp (Sceliphron caementarium). Although some wasps target the Hobo Spider, the Praying Mantis is one predator that is a big threat to the Hobo Spider. They are also used widely for eliminating the Hobo Spiders from certain communities. Hobo Spiders are not aggressive or dangerous. They may attack a human if provoked but that stays true for any animal. Since Hobo Spiders are usually found around in houses, they have a higher tendency to come in contact with a human. Hence, it may attack a human but whether they are poisonous or not is still under debate. In the past, there were two or more cases that suggested Hobo Spiders caused necrosis. But as per today’s research, there have only been two cases of Hobo Spider bites but the only symptoms were redness and itching. However, a spider bite is hard to identify because the spider is harder to recognize. This is why the matter still remains a mystery. Here is how you can prevent Hobo Spiders from living in your space; Take a look at some of our other amazing spider articles!",
