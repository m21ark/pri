        "Fun_Fact": "Huntaways have a strong instinct for herding.",
        "Text": "Huntaways are known for their loud, deep, and sustained barking when they herd sheep. The Huntaway dog was first bred in New Zealand in the early 1900s. Farmers needed a sturdy, fast dog with a talent for keeping track of their herds of sheep. The combination of speed, agility, and stamina possessed by this canine has earned it the nickname, New Zealand\u2019s sheepdog. They are categorized in the herding group. See all of our expert product reviews . This dog\u2019s temperament is affectionate and protective. They are fond of children especially when running around, jumping, and playing games. A family searching for a smart, energy-filled dog with a loyal nature should give this breed a closer look. Sheep farmers in New Zealand soon found that a new herding companion was required to enable them to keep abreast of their flocks at all times. They were going to need an intelligent, energetic canine, with a loud bark, and the ability to work alone or as part of a team. It took combining several breeds: collies, English hounds, labradors, and Old English sheepdogs, and the rest as they say is history. By the 1900s, the huntaway came into being. A large, hardy canine, it came with a deep, bark which could carry for miles. It was also sufficiently robust to cover large distances and handle inclement weather, making it the perfect herding assistant for sheep farmers in a different new climate. See all of our expert product reviews . This breed is a sturdy, compact dog. A male can grow to a height of 26 inches and a female can be 24 inches tall at the shoulder. A male can be as heavy as 88 pounds while a female can weigh 77 pounds. Seven-week-old puppies weigh an average of five to six pounds. They are full-grown by the age of 18 months. This breed has a certain amount of health issues for potential owners to consider. Hip dysplasia is a health issue of this lively dog. This is when the hip joint has not formed correctly. A limping or hopping dog may be experiencing this condition. Unfortunately, bone cancer is another health issue faced by this breed. A visible lump, lameness, or pain are all potential signs of bone cancer in this dog. The treatment depends on the severity and specific type of bone cancer involved. Ear infections are also common in dogs with long ears and this breed is no exception. Mud or dusty debris can accumulate in this dog\u2019s ears, leading to bacteria growth and infection. Regular cleaning is a good tactic to prevent infection. But, if this dog gets an ear issue, these infections can be treated by a vet. The most common health issues are: This dog is always alert to its surroundings. Alertness and agility are two of the most important traits in a dog bred to take charge of a large flock of sheep. Even if it\u2019s not herding sheep, this dog notices the activities going on all around it. So, if a family member picks up a ball or a frisbee for a game, this canine will take note! Though they were bred for the hard work of herding sheep on a ranch or farm, these dogs are known for their affectionate behavior. They love to be praised and patted. This is a great quality for a family dog. Unlike a basset hound or a bulldog , a Huntaway has a lively personality. This dog would fit well into a family that likes to be traveling around and having fun! Caring for a Huntaway puppy or older dog is easier if you know more about the breed\u2019s specific needs. Giving this pet the proper diet, exercise, healthcare, and grooming attention can help it to live a long and happy life in your family. The right diet gives your Huntaway the energy it needs to get through its active day. Huntaway puppies require a different diet than full-grown dogs. Huntaway puppy food: These puppies need DHA in their diet to support the healthy development of their eyesight and brain. Protein aids the development of muscles and bones. Paying special attention to healthy bone development is important in a breed vulnerable to bone cancer. Carbohydrates give these puppies the energy to support their running, jumping, and exploring activities. It\u2019s best to serve these puppies four small meals each day to keep their energy up throughout their waking hours. Huntaway adult dog food: Protein in an adult dog\u2019s diet contributes to the strong muscles and cartilage of this very active pooch. Calcium is an ingredient that adds even more strength to this dog\u2019s bones. Maintaining the bone health of this dog may head off hip dysplasia. Fat in its diet gives it stamina and energy for the long periods of running characteristic of this dog. Vitamin A maintains this dog\u2019s healthy eyesight. Adult dogs should be fed twice per day, once in the morning and once in the early evening so the food can be digested before sleep time. The A-Z Animals choice best dog food for Huntaways is Victor Purpose \u2013 Performance Dry Dog Food. Meet a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate that helps keep Huntaways\u2019 joints mobile and pain-free, all in a formula specifically for active dogs.

Here\u2019s where to get Victor Purpose Performance Dog Food on Chewy and Amazon. How much does a Huntaway shed? These dogs are average shedders. Keep in mind they do increase shedding activity at the start of the summer season. A good grooming routine for this dog involves brushing its short, wavy coat once per week. At the beginning of the summer season when this dog sheds more than normal, a slicker brush can remove dead hair from its coat. They are prone to getting infections in their ears. This is common for many dogs that have long, furry ears. So, when grooming, take a moist, soft cloth and wipe the underside of each ear to remove excess wax and dirt. Ask a vet if there is a mild cleaning solution that would be appropriate to use on the dog\u2019s ears. Cleaning a Huntaway\u2019s ears gives you a chance to spot any potential infection right away so you can get treatment for it if necessary. Like most herding dogs, Huntaways are intelligent with alert senses. Consequently, the obedience training process is relatively simple with this breed. Daily exercise is at the top of the list of requirements for this dog. They are strong dogs with stamina so taking this pet to a nearby field or woods is a great way to just let it run off some energy! It\u2019s a smart idea to make sure your Huntaway is fully trained before letting it off the leash to run in any environment. Come up with games that give this dog a task to complete. Like playing a game of tug-of-war with a rope bone or asking the dog to find a toy you\u2019ve hidden somewhere in the yard. Think about it. These dogs were bred for the task of herding sheep. So, they are most happy when they have a goal to work for. Is this dog appropriate for life in an apartment ? No, it needs more space than an apartment can provide A farm or a home with a large fenced-in back or front yard are the best types of homes for this pooch with the sweet personality. Socialization is important for any dog breed but is especially critical for this one. Why? Because a Huntaway puppy that\u2019s not properly socialized is likely to grow into an adult dog that tries to herd children, adults, and pets in a home. Keep in mind they are only doing what they were bred to do. But careful socialization from the time it is a puppy can show this breed when herding behavior is appropriate. Even a socialized Huntaway can revert to its natural herding instincts. So, it\u2019s best to keep an eye on the meetings between a child and the family\u2019s Huntaway until it\u2019s clear the dog understands what is expected of it. Border Collies, Australian Cattle dogs, and Belgian Sheepdogs are all similar breeds to the Huntaway. Popular names for this breed:",

        "Text": "\u201cThe Belgian sheepdog is the preferred breed of US Navy SEAL teams.\u201d Belgian sheepdogs are a medium-sized breed which was originally developed to herd sheep in Belgium. Over the years, they have also proven themselves to be valuable assets to the military, police, search-and-rescue-teams, people in need of service animals, and families wanting a loyal companion and brave protector. Highly intelligent, social, and energetic, these dogs are easily trainable and will take on much larger animals or people without hesitation to protect their families. They do require a dedicated owner who is willing to put time and energy into their socialization and training. Otherwise, these dogs may revert to instinct and display alpha behaviors, including herding children like sheep, fighting other dogs, and becoming hyper-territorial. A well-mannered Belgian sheepdog will channel these instincts into enthusiastic play, watchfulness, and an appropriate reserve when meeting strangers. See all of our expert product reviews . Belgian Sheepdogs come in four varieties: No matter what breed of dog you select, plan on providing them with a high-quality dog food made with real meat and healthy vegetables and grains. Avoid cheap foods with artificial additives and hard-to-digest fillers. You may save yourself a lot of heartache and money in the long run by proactively keeping your dog healthy rather than treating health conditions that may arise from poor nutrition. An energetic breed such as a Belgian sheepdog has a special need for quality sources of protein. A-Z Animals recommends Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula Natural Adult Dry Dog Food .

Belgian sheepdogs are a medium-sized breed, ranging from 24-26 inches tall for males and 22-24 inches tall for females. Adult males may weigh 65-75 pounds, while females are slightly smaller at 60-70 pounds. Belgian sheepdogs are a hardy breed that do not have excessive health problems as compared to other breeds. Some issues to watch out for that tend to be common issues in dogs in general are hypothyroidism, seizures, allergies, elbow and hip dysplasia, the eye conditions Pannus and Progressive retinal atrophy, and hemangiosarcoma (liver and spleen cancer). Don\u2019t be unduly alarmed by this list. Belgian sheepdogs have a relatively long-life expectancy of 10-14 years. See all of our expert product reviews . Here is a list summarizing possible health issues affecting some Belgian sheepdogs. Having been developed to herd sheep, this breed is athletic, alert, and intelligent. They can pour on the power for huge bursts of speed but also have great endurance to run or play steadily for a long time. This is a dog that requires a great deal of exercise and space to run and play. They will tend to treat children or household pets like sheep and herd them by chasing and nipping at their heels. They also have strong instincts to guard and protect their herd. This makes them cautious around strangers, attentive, and vocal. They bark quite a bit to alert their owners to possible danger. They like to chase prey, and without training will chase cats, squirrels, and passing bicycles with equal gusto. Belgian sheepdogs are fiercely loyal to their families and will sacrifice themselves without hesitation even if confronted by a larger dog or other animal or a threatening human. These dogs are highly social and will much prefer living in the house with you than outdoors in a kennel. They can adapt to life in an apartment or small house if given lots of exercise and interaction. However, their tendency to bark a lot, especially when left alone, may be annoying to neighbors living in close proximity. So, a detached house with a fenced yard is the best living situation for them. This breed comes in black, brindle, cream, or fawn coloring. Their coats are relatively easy to maintain, and they don\u2019t need frequent bathing. Just brush them about once a week. They shed heavily once a year and require more frequent brushing at that time. You can also give them some warm baths and blow dry them to loosen up dead hair during shedding season. Belgian sheepdogs are intelligent, energetic, social, and enjoy having work to do. All these traits make them relatively easily trainable. They do not respond well to harsh training techniques and can become stubborn if that approach is attempted. It is essential to train and socialize this breed to channel their instincts and alpha behaviors in constructive directions that will serve your family well and make your pet into a well-mannered companion. These dogs require daily vigorous exercise. If you like jogging, biking, or hiking, this dog will be in heaven trotting along by your side. If you and your family have a more sedentary lifestyle or do not have the time to be active with your dog during the week, this is not the best breed for you. Keep in mind that it\u2019s not enough simply to turn a Belgian sheepdog out in a fenced yard to play alone. They are very social and will want to play with you, not entertain themselves. They have a tendency toward separation anxiety and will act out by barking, chewing, destroying things, and trying to escape enclosures. This breed does just fine with children if properly trained and socialized. Without training, it will chase your children down, nip at them, and try to herd them all together. It may also attempt to intervene in conflicts or play between kids that it thinks require an aggressive or protective response.

        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Fun_Fact": "The Spanador is a good swimmer.",
        "Text": "The Labrador Retriever has many of the qualities of a good swimmer: a water-resistant coat, extra feet webbing, and a very athletic body. The Spanador may inherit some or all of these traits as well. The Spanador is a mix between two different purebred dogs: a Cocker Spaniel (particularly the American Cocker Spaniel ) and a Labrador Retriever . When you combine two different purebred dogs together, you get what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cdesigner dog.\u201d These hybrids combine different aspects of their two parent breeds. The Cocker Spaniel is a small hunting dog (specialized for hunting the woodcock, hence the name) that probably originated somewhere in Europe during the Late Medieval period. The Labrador Retriever is a mid-sized hunting dog that originated in Newfoundland, Canada in the early 19th century. It was specifically bred to retrieve the game from water. Today it excels as a therapy, search and rescue, and service dog. See all of our expert product reviews . Depending on which traits it inherits from either parent, the Spanador will likely have an athletic build, strong paws, pointed muzzle, and long, floppy ears, sometimes fringed with hair. The medium to long straight coat will have some combination of black, white, cream, fawn, or red colors or markings. There are many different variations to choose from. The Spanador is a small to medium sized dog with an athletic frame. Males are ever so slightly larger than females. Spanadors are considered \u2018designer dogs\u2019, i.e., breeds created by the intentional crossing of others. In this case, this breed is a cross between the cocker spaniel and the labrador. As such its members have origins from Spain, and Britain, by way of their cocker spaniel forebears which were engaged in hunting woodcock. Their labrador parentage also has British origins as well as a lengthy history of hunting wildfowl. See all of our expert product reviews . Spanadors come with excellent swimming capabilities thanks to their Labrador parents which used to dive into cold waters to retrieve fish. They also take after them in terms of their ability to tuck away impressive quantities of food. They are also especially energetic thanks to the athleticism of both their parent breeds. The Spanador is generally a healthy dog, but like its two parent breeds, it may be prone to several health conditions. These include obesity, allergies, cataracts, cancer, ear infections, dry skin, progressive retinal atrophy, hip dysplasia (resulting in temporary dislocations), and Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus, also known as bloating (a very serious condition that can cause the stomach to expand and even rupture). It is impossible to predict exactly what it will inherit ahead of time, so if you\u2019re buying a new puppy, it\u2019s very important that you make sure it comes from a healthy stock with few genetic disorders and an excellent medical history. A healthy dog that avoids many serious issues should have an excellent lifespan of some 12 to 15 years. To sum up some of the most common health problems: The Spanador is a very gentle and affectionate dog that forms a close and deep bond with its owner as both a companion and a playmate. It wants nothing more than to be an eager participant in its owner\u2019s life. The Spanador is not very well-suited for apartment living, since it needs plenty of space in which to live and play. Potential owners should be aware that this dog does need quite a lot of attention. If left alone for too long, it could become easily bored and create trouble around the home. This dog can also become very excitable and start to jump on furniture and people, but it can be trained to avoid this behavior, and it does tend to become calmer later in life. The Spanador is not an easy dog to care for, especially in single-person homes. It does require quite a bit of attention and maintenance in terms of its diet, grooming, and exercise habits. If you decide that the Spanador is right for you, then the first step is to find a trustworthy place that sells this hybrid. A high-quality breeder or a rescue group is your best bet. While there may not be many Spanador rescue groups around, you might be able to find one in a Cocker Spaniel or Labrador Retriever-specific group that takes in mixes. Once you bring your dog home, it will need to receive regular veterinary checks, even if it appears otherwise healthy. They can catch health problems as they arise. If you have any other questions about the dog\u2019s routine, then you should consult with the vet. Depending on its age, weight, and activity level, the Spanador may need around 2 cups of food specifically designed for highly athletic dogs. This should preferably be divided into a few meals per day to prevent bloating. This dog also has the tendency to gain weight quickly. Its calorie intake needs to be carefully monitored and controlled as necessary if it starts to show signs of weight gain. To accommodate dogs like Spanadors with a propensity for allergies, there is a wide range of allergy-alleviating limited ingredient dog foods. At A-Z Animals, we like Purina Beyond Simply, Natural Chicken Adult Dry Dog Food for Spanadors. There are no peas, lentils, or potatoes, and no corn, soy, or wheat, and no artificial additives that often end up being the culprit behind allergies for sensitive dogs like Spanadors. This balanced nutrition, limited ingredient dog food has omegas for the immune system, skin, and coat, with calcium, and tons of vitamins. Your Spanador will enjoy Purina Beyond Simply Natural Chicken Dog Food, available on Chewy and Amazon. As part of its regular grooming routine, the Spanador needs to be brushed several times a week throughout the year, preferably with a simple pin brush and comb, to prevent matting and maintain a healthy coat. During its heavy shedding months in the summer, the frequency of the brushes needs to be increased to almost every single day. This needs to be complemented with daily teeth brushes to prevent gum disease and semi-regular ear checks to remove debris and obstructions. The Spanador only requires baths whenever it becomes dirty; it is recommended that you use a special shampoo designed for dry skin. The Spanador should be an easy dog to train. It is generally eager to please and quick to grasp commands, although there may be moments when it becomes distracted and ignores its owner. During these moments, it is never a good idea to act negatively toward it. This dog responds best to positive reinforcement methods, so you should shower it with praise, treats, and other rewards for a job well done. The Spanador excels at all types of training, from basic commands to more advanced tricks. The Spanador is a highly energetic dog that needs more than an hour of exercise every single day. As a physically versatile mix, it loves to fetch, swim, perform tricks, play with toys, and accompany its owner on long walks or jogs. It is a good idea to have a large backyard or any other enclosed area nearby. When going for walks or runs, you should keep your dog on a leash, because it has the tendency to wander around and may stop responding to your commands. While they can be a little fragile and thus require special handling, Puppies are bundles of affection and energy. They are eager to explore their surroundings and play with people. However, this dog does need time to grow and develop before it can really start engaging in strenuous physical activity. To avoid serious health problems, you should do your research about the best places to obtain a puppy. Try to avoid low-quality breeders or puppy mills that do not screen for health issues. The Spanador seems to have a natural affinity for children. Its approachable size and fun, engaging personality make it an ideal companion for the entire family. The only downside is that its excitable behavior could be a problem around smaller children, so it is probably not a good idea to leave them alone together. The Spanador obviously shares much in common with its two parent breeds, the Cocker Spaniel and the Labrador Retriever. You might also want to consider the following types of dogs as well: The Spanador is a bit of a niche dog and so there aren\u2019t many famous examples of it, but the two parent breeds are quite well-known. The Labrador Retriever is the most popular breed in the United States and has appeared throughout pop culture and works of fiction. You might also recognize the American Cocker Spaniel from the 1955 film Lady and the Tramp and from several famous owners (like George Clooney and Richard Nixon).

        "Name": "Pyrenean Shepherd",
        "Genus": "Canis",
        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Text": "\u201cThis breed is an energetic, \u2018ball of fire!\u2019\u201d The Pyrenean shepherd, also known as the Pyrenean sheepdog or the Pyr shep, is a small-to-medium-sized breed that may have existed in Europe for over 4,000 years. They are the smallest and most popular herding breed with sheep ranchers in the Pyrenees Mountains of France. Pyrenean shepherds are energetic and have great stamina, which enables them to run long distances at high altitudes. They are intelligent and mischievous, with a great deal of nervous energy. They are shy around strangers but devoted to their families and excellent with children. Their coats come in long, medium, and short lengths in a variety of colors and do not require very much care. The long-haired variety has an endearing \u201cscruffy dog\u201d appearance that makes them look charming and mischievous. This breed does need a lot of mental and physical stimulation, so they do best with a family that can give them the time and attention they need. They are not great pets for inexperienced dog owners. Regardless of breed, your dog should be provided with high-quality dog food, manufactured or home-prepared from the most natural ingredients possible, without artificial additives or poor-quality fillers. Spending a little more for higher quality can save you from expensive vet bills as your dog gets older. Because Pyrenean shepherds are a particularly active breed, it is especially important to provide them with a high-protein diet. Wet or dry dog food will work, along with a small amount of meat scraps or meat broth to make their food savory and protein rich. For dogs with high protein requirements, A-Z Animals recommends Instinct Grain Free Dry Dog Food . It is 40% protein, minimally processed, and sourced responsibly from cage-free chicken. It contains no grain products, artificial colors, or preservatives. It\u2019s available in five flavors and is suitable for dogs of all ages. The Pyrenean shepherd is a small-to-medium-sized dog with an average height of 16-21 inches tall for males and 15-20 inches tall for females. Males and females can weigh anywhere from 18-33 lbs when fully grown. Pyrenean shepherds are a healthy breed with few known health issues. They can have a long lifespan of 17 or more years. The American Kennel Club recommends that they receive evaluations for potential problems with the patella, hips, or eyes. Some of their common conditions are: True to their origins as outstanding herding dogs, Pyrenean shepherds have strong traits of intelligence, independence, courage, loyalty, and versatility. Their typical personality is exuberant, playful, enthusiastic, and affectionate. Their behavior with children is excellent: they enjoy playing and performing tricks. Another positive behavior is that they are good protectors, being wary of strangers and vocal about any perceived threats. No one will be able to approach your yard or door without your dog keeping you well-informed! This trait can also make them tricky to deal with if you have other pets. Their herding instincts may make them hyper-protective or want to dominate and herd other animals. Because Pyrenean shepherds have been developed as working dogs, not for a desired appearance, there is great variation in their coats. The coloration can be fawn, grey, blue, brindle, or black, and they sometimes have white on their chest and legs. Their coats may be long, medium (goat-haired), or short (smooth-faced). The coat may lay flat or be slightly wavy and charmingly scruffy-looking. Their coats feel coarse and they do not have much of an undercoat. Their fur does not mat or shed very much. The fur of those with long coats may cord naturally. Owners should brush medium and short-haired varieties every two weeks or so. Long-haired Pyrenean shepherds should be brushed weekly. All breeds of dogs should have their nails regularly trimmed and their teeth brushed to maintain their appearance and prevent potentially life-threatening infection. Bred as herding dogs, Pyrenean shepherds like having a job or activity to do. Because they have such high energy and are eager to please their owners, they are a very trainable breed. An interesting trait of these dogs is that they were bred to herd using their bodies, not using eye contact as some other breeds do. As a result, they can more easily develop an intuitive sense of what they should do. Reward-based methods using clickers, verbal praise, and small treats work very well with them. Because of their high training needs, these dogs are not a good match for inexperienced dog owners. Pyrenean shepherds are extremely energetic! Owners who like running and would enjoy teaching a dog to play fetch and performing obedience and agility tasks will appreciate the personality traits of this breed. They can be trained to run alongside a bicycle, which is a win-win for cycling enthusiasts. These dogs will become anxious and will bark excessively, dig, and create general mayhem if left alone too long. They can adapt to life in either a home or apartment, if given enough stimulation, attention, and opportunities to exercise vigorously. Pyrenean shepherds tend to be suspicious and reserved toward strangers and other animals. This means as puppies they need a great deal of socialization to become well-mannered family pets. They reach full maturity at about three years old. They bond intensely with their families, so it is difficult for them to form new attachments to another family if they are rehomed. Prospective owners should not choose this breed unless they are firmly committed to the dog for life, which can be more than 15 years. This breed can be an outstanding companion to children, and is more than able to keep up with their level of activity. Pyrenean shepherds are nervous, hyper-alert dogs, though, so they can easily become alarmed by unexpected movements and noises from unfamiliar children. These dogs may chase and nip at children as they would sheep. Owners should correct this behavior immediately and consistently so the dog learns its subordinate place in the hierarchy of the family.

        "Genus": "Canis",
        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Text": "The Estrela Mountain Dog breed started as a herd-guarding dog in Portugal. Today, this breed is the companion dog of the Portuguese police force. These large, agile dogs make excellent guard dogs because they are incredibly loyal to their masters and wary of strangers. Proper socialization in their early days is crucial; without it, you will have a huge dog who could become aggressive to those outside his family. See all of our expert product reviews . These dogs are a calm, watchful breed that is wonderful with children. So, their loyalty makes them excellent family pets. Also referred to as cao da Serra da Estrela, this domestic canine is considered to be one of the oldest breeds in the mountainous region for which it is named. While no one can quite decide on whether it was introduced to the Estrela Mountains by the Romans or the Visigoths, they can agree on the fact that this hardy, intelligent dog was bred over the course of centuries for agility in navigating tricky mountain paths, an insulating coat for handling the mountainous chill, and endurance for chasing errant sheep on limited sustenance. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . In the 1900s attempts were made to establish standards for the breed which had faced stiff competition from other foreign breeds. By the mid-20th century, its visibility began to increase thanks to its participation at shows. Today the breed can currently be found in the USA and the UK. It can also be found in its native Portugal where it continues to guard livestock, is the canine of choice for the National Police force, and is also a much-loved family pet. Estrella Mountain Dogs are a giant breed that can weigh 77 to 132 pounds and stand between 24 and 30 inches high at the shoulder. The males of this breed are slightly larger than the females. They have a thick, wavy coat that comes in a variety of colors, including gray, yellow and fawn. See all of our expert product reviews . As with all purebreds, responsible breeders are the key to generations of healthy dogs. That said, these dogs are a generally healthy breed and don\u2019t have any particular genetic diseases to worry about, though, like any large breed, they are susceptible to hip and elbow dysplasia. Estrela Mountain Dogs are courageous and loyal and therefore make excellent guard dogs. They have an adaptable, laidback personality, so they will be happy taking long walks and hikes or just curling up beside their owners. These dogs get along great with children and with other dogs and make wonderful family pets. They do have a bit of a prey drive, so if you want them to get along with cats or other small animals, you should introduce these animals to them when they are puppies. These dogs are highly intelligent, which is both a blessing and a curse in terms of training. They can learn new tricks and commands with ease, but you must be consistent with the rules. Otherwise, they will decide they will only follow your lead when they want to. This breed also has a fair amount of wanderlust and likes to have large open areas to roam. This wanderlust makes them ill-suited for apartment living. This is an easy breed to maintain. As long as you feed them high-quality food, give them a moderate amount of daily exercise and establish a simple grooming regimen, you\u2019ll have a happy and healthy canine companion for many years to come. These dogs do quite well on high-quality food for extra large dogs. They don\u2019t have any particular dietary concerns. During puppyhood, go with a puppy food rich in nutrients like calcium, DHA, and protein, then transition to an equally nutritious adult dog food. A-Z Animals says the best dog food for Estrela Mountain Dogs is Purina Pro Plan Large Breed Adult Dry Dog Food Chicken with Shreds. The poultry ingredients in this chicken-based large breed dog food are natural sources of glucosamine for stabile, mobile joints. Additionally, there are adequate levels of calcium and phosphorus to fortify the bones and the cartilage in joints for extra support. Check Chewy or Amazon for this product. These dogs have no particular health concerns that need consideration when choosing pet insurance . There is no special maintenance involved in caring for these dogs. This breed sheds moderately year-round, so you should brush them regularly to reduce their shedding. Beyond that, all you need to do to keep them happy and healthy is to keep a grooming regimen that includes brushing their teeth, keeping their ears cleaned, and clipping their nails. Again, these dogs are quite intelligent and can master new tricks and commands with ease. This intelligence, however, often leads to stubbornness, so you\u2019ll need to firm but gentle and consistent with the rules to earn your dog\u2019s respect. After puppyhood, this is a fairly calm breed that doesn\u2019t need much exercise. For instance, one walk each day or a game of fetch in the backyard should keep this gentle giant happy. Like any other breed, the puppies have more energy than the adults, so you\u2019ll need to spend more time exercising them when they are young to prevent the destructiveness that comes with pent-up energy. Early socialization is also important, particularly if you plan to raise them with cats or other small animals. They can be quite stubborn when it comes to training, so puppy obedience classes would give a new owner some welcomed help in this arena. Fortunately, the calm, protective nature of these dogs makes them fantastic companions for children. As with any large breed, you\u2019ll need to teach both dogs and children how to safely interact with one another and never leave them unsupervised to prevent any accidental injuries. A few breeds that are similar in size or temperament to these dogs include the Newfoundland , Saint Bernard, and the Bernese Mountain Dog . Here are a few great names for an Estrela Mountain Dog:",

A high-energy, courageous, and highly trainable pup, this dog\u2019s name literally translates to hunting terrier . After World War I, a group of hunters separated from the Fox-Terrier Club to create a breed focused purely on hunting performance, especially for underground prey and felled birds.

        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Behavior": "Their temperament can be characterized as intelligent, quiet and calm.",
        "Text": "While the exact mix of dogs that were crossbred to create the American Water Spaniel are not fully known, many people suspect that the Irish Water Spaniel, the English Water Spaniel (now extinct), and the Curly-Coated Retriever were used. American Water Spaniels were bred in Wisconsin and Minnesota as hunting dogs who would be good at retrieving waterfowl. Wisconsin and Minnesota are cold, and the European immigrants were looking to create a dog who would fare well swimming in colder water to retrieve waterfowl. See all of our expert product reviews . Dogs from this medium-sized breed are very skilled swimmers like their likely ancestors, the English Water Spaniel, Curly-Coated Retriever, and Irish Water Spaniel. They are able to quickly retrieve waterfowl that have been shot down. Additionally, this breed is also used for bird flushing with different game birds such as pheasants , quails , and grouse . There are not many of this breed left; it is estimated that there are only about 3,000 still around. This breed of dog is a pretty even-tempered dog. They are energetic and love playing. They can also be very affectionate and can be a great choice for a family pet, so long as they are given plenty of exercise. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The American Water Spaniel is an example of the Americans\u2019 ability to take European breeds and modify them for their own needs. Settlers in Wisconsin and Minnesota wanted a breed of dog that could help them hunt the waterfowl in and around the Great Lakes, so they created the American Water Spaniel. The exact origin of the breed is unknown, but it is thought to have been created from the Irish Water Spaniel, the Curly-Coated Retriever, and the English Water Spaniel (extinct). This illustrates the resourcefulness of Americans when faced with new problems. The originators of the American Water Spaniel breed, whose identities have been lost, designed it as an all-purpose hunting dog. It is a skilled retriever of waterfowl and can also be used to hunt upland game birds, such as grouse, quail, and pheasant, as well as rabbits. See all of our expert product reviews . Throughout the years, the American Water Spaniel\u2019s numbers decreased as a result of a decline in the duck population in the region, as well as a shift from hunting for sustenance to hunting for leisure. There are an estimated 3,000 of them left in the world. The American Water Spaniel was officially accepted into the American Kennel Club in 1940 and was designated as the official state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. The American Water Spaniel has a lifespan of 10-12 years and usually has a litter size of 4-6 puppies. Female dogs usually go into heat every six months, which lasts 18-21 days and is divided into four portions. Once pregnant, the average gestation period lasts 58-65 days, with the puppies almost fully developed by the 58th day. At birth, newborn puppies have not yet developed an effective immune system, so they rely on their mother\u2019s colostrum to gain passive immunity in the first 24-48 hours after delivery. This helps protect them from diseases in their early weeks of life. It is very important to protect them from an illness during the first 4 months of life. They should be kept away from any other pets that are sick. They should also be quarantined from areas frequented by animals, like pet stores and dog parks, until they are fully vaccinated. These are medium-sized dogs. Both males and females are between 15 and 18 inches tall. Males, who are typically a bit heavier than their female counterparts, weigh between 30 and 45 pounds. Females weigh between 25 and 40 pounds. Three-month-old puppies weigh between 16 and 21 pounds, and six-month-old puppies weigh between 29 and 39 pounds. Both male and female puppies will be fully grown by the time they are 16 months old. There are a few key health concerns you should be aware of with this breed. One is hip dysplasia. With this condition, a dog\u2019s hip does not form correctly, and there is a poor fit between the hip socket and the femur. The bones rub together, which can lead to pain and may make it more challenging for your dog to walk. American Water Spaniels also sometimes suffer from Progressive Retinal Atrophy. Also called PRA, this is a condition in which the photoreceptor cells of the retina start to degenerate. This condition will eventually lead to blindness, and there is currently no cure or treatment for it. Epilepsy is another possible problem. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes recurring seizures. Approximately 1% of all dogs are affected by this disorder. To review, some potential health issues may include: American Water Spaniels were bred to be hunting dogs. As such, they are a very active breed who enjoy playing, hunting, and doing other types of work. When their activity needs are met, these dogs exhibit a variety of traits that allow them to make excellent family pets. They have an affectionate and playful personalities and enjoy spending time with children and other family members. This breed often develops a close bond with its family members, often with one family member in particular. In some instances, they may be stubborn or exhibit possessive behaviors, but breeders have been trying to breed dogs that are more even-tempered and well-suited for families. Knowing about this breed can help you provide the best care possible for your dog. Since all dog breeds are unique, caring for this breed, in particular, will look different from caring for other dog breeds. This dog breed should be fed a high-quality dog food that will meet their nutritional needs. You may choose to feed your adult dog or puppy bagged food, or you may choose to offer them a home-prepared diet. Either way, it\u2019s important for American Water Spaniels to get the specific nutrients they need to stave off the most common health complications. With this in mind, A-Z Animals chooses Merrick Backcountry Raw Infused Healthy Grains Dry Dog Food as the best dog food for American Water Spaniels. Since this breed can develop joint problems, hip dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy, owners should look for food with chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and taurine for the eyes. These are the nutrients that make this dog food ideal for American Water Spaniels. Plus, the amino acids are great for these dogs\u2019 coats, as well as fortifying their nervous system since they can get seizures. Check Chewy or Amazon for this product. When selecting or preparing food for your dog, you should consult with its veterinarian. The veterinarian can help you make sure that the food you are offering contains the essential vitamins and nutrients your dog will need. Taking your dog\u2019s age, activity level, and health into consideration when planning their diet will also be important. Adult dogs typically eat between 1 and 2 cups of food a day, but your dog\u2019s specific needs will help determine the amount of food they\u2019ll need. Since dogs can become overweight, it will be important to feed them the right amount of food. Also, because of this risk factor with this breed, you will want to split their food into two or three meals instead of offering the full amount all at once. Water Spaniel puppies have smaller stomachs than adults. Puppies should eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day. This type of dog\u2019s coat should be brushed weekly, but the process is not too difficult. This breed has a double-layer coat that is designed to provide them with insulation against the cold water in Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region where they were bred. For much of the year, especially during shedding season, you can use a slicker brush when brushing your dog. This brush type will help pull out the dead hair in the undercoat. Their coat will be less full during the summer, and most times, a rubber-tipped pin brush will be the best option to clean it up during these months. In addition to brushing its coat, you\u2019ll also want to keep its nails trimmed, so they do not get too long. Be ready to begin training and socializing your dog right away. Starting both of these from an early age will help your dog learn how to appropriately interact with other dogs, people, and situations. While some American Water Spaniels may be a little stubborn, most are very eager to please. This trait will help make it easy to train your dog. Additionally, they can be very talented and agile and can do well in different sporting games, field events, or tracking agility. Making sure your dog gets enough exercise each day is important. This breed is very active and loves spending time outdoors swimming or hunting. They were originally bred for retrieving waterfowl and bird flushing and do very well when they are given a job, taken on hunting trips, or given other forms of more vigorous exercise. However, they will also do fine when they are taken to a dog park or given time to play with their own in the backyard each day. American Water Spaniels may become destructive or bark more when they aren\u2019t provided with enough opportunities for exercise. This is another reason you\u2019ll want to keep your dog active. If you are going to be purchasing or adopting an American Water Spaniel, the first thing you should do is prepare your home for the new puppy. Puppies can be very active and may chew on things or get into trouble, so you will want to be sure to remove any items that could be potentially dangerous to your new dog. Also, if you have personal belongings that you don\u2019t want to see destroyed by a puppy, it would be a good idea to put them away. Once you bring your puppy home, it will be important to make sure they get enough exercise. American Water Spaniels are very active dogs, and puppies should get plenty of playtimes and other activities. Puppies between the ages of 6 and 18 months will need more activity than older dogs will. When planning your puppy\u2019s diet, keep in mind that they have smaller stomachs than adults. Because of this, your puppy will need to eat smaller meals throughout the day. For example, puppies between the ages of 8 and 12 months should be fed four times a day, and puppies between the ages of 3 and 6 months should eat three times a day. American Water Spaniels can make a good family pet. When properly trained, they are known for being very obedient. They are also very affectionate and can be very gentle with children. If you are bringing an American Water Spaniel home to be a family dog, you will still want to closely supervise your children when they are with the dog. This can help avoid either your children or the dog getting injured by accident. Three dog breeds that are similar to the American Water Spaniel are the Curly Coated Retriever, English Springer Spaniel , and Field Spaniel. The American Water Spaniel is the state dog of Wisconsin. Since this is a relatively rare breed, there are not too many celebrities or other famous individuals who own an American Water Spaniel.

        "Text": "\u201cThe Scottish deerhound was bred to hunt the giant red deer.\u201d The Scottish deerhound is a giant coursing hound bred in Scotland to hunt the giant red deer . Evidence suggests that deerstalking hounds like the deerhound were in Scotland well before the Scots; Scottish chieftains later refined and revered the breed for its hunting prowess. One of the tallest dog breeds around, the Scottish deerhound\u2019s roots can be traced back to the ancient greyhound . Known as the \u201cRoyal Dog of Scotland,\u201d the Scots so valued the breed that they promoted exclusive breeding, almost causing the breed to die out. Lovers of the breed favor its dark blue-gray coat, though the breed comes in a few other colors. Though a giant, the deerhound is gentle, friendly, and docile. It is open to strangers and likes children, though its size may intimidate small children. The deerhound is also good with other dogs. It is eager to please its owner and is responsive to positive training. The Scottish deerhound prefers spending time with the family, but it needs lots of space to run. Daily neighborhood walks and playtime in a small backyard are not enough to fulfill its exercise needs. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times to your deerhound. In order to combat bloating, feed your dog several small meals a day rather than a couple of larger ones. Also, avoid allowing your dog to exercise around mealtime. The Scottish deerhound has some unique dietary demands. It\u2019s important to add omega fatty acids, glucosamine, and chondroitin for coat and joint health. They need high-quality protein, though the breed can suffer from stress and fatigue if they gain weight too quickly, especially as puppies. In addition, they also mature slowly, not reaching their adult frame until they reach nearly two years. Feeding them concentrated, high-energy food can be harmful. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . We at A-Z Animals Recommend Solid Gold Wolf King Bison & Brown Rice Recipe . Keep in mind that the presence of peas in this food may be an issue for dogs prone to dilated cardiomyopathy. Consult with your veterinarian about your dog\u2019s diet and health. The Scottish deerhound is an enormous dog breed! A male deerhound stands 30-32 inches at the shoulder, and a female stands at least 28 inches. A male weighs about 85-110 pounds, and a female weighs 75-95. The Scottish deerhound has some genetic health issues that can be handled through proper care and foresight. Make sure you go through a responsible breeder who will perform the necessary genetic tests to determine if your dog is susceptible to some of these genetic issues. A key component of your deerhound\u2019s health is its level of exercise and its fulfillment and happiness. The dog\u2019s inclusion in the family\u2019s daily life is a big part of that. To avoid injuries and other issues, only engage the dog in age-appropriate exercise when it is under 18 months. A reputable breeder can be a lifelong resource for health and training knowledge and can instruct you on what exercises are appropriate for your dog. Below are some potential problems you may want to screen your Scottish deerhound for. Some of these conditions are well managed with early intervention. This aggressive cancer doesn\u2019t usually affect larger dogs but has been known to develop in the deerhound. This is a gradual weakening of the heart muscle for which there is no cure. Make sure the vet check\u2019s your puppy for signs of this condition and yearly thereafter. Exercise intolerance and a cough are also symptoms of this condition. It can be managed, but the vet has to detect it early. Typically occurring in males, this type of stone can cause blockages of the bladder, resulting in a urinary tract infection. Always observe your dog to make sure that it doesn\u2019t have trouble urinating, and check for other signs of urinary discomfort. Seek immediate veterinary advice if there are any signs of this problem. Deerhounds (and other sighthounds) may have disorders which come into play during or after surgery. Bleeding disorders like a factor VII deficiency can cause bleeding problems and inhibit recovery, or even prove to be fatal. Responsible breeders can usually detect these through genetic testing as puppies, but sometimes they miss it. Speak with the veterinarian before any surgery to discuss this possibility. Scottish deerhounds also can have fatal reactions to anesthesia. Finally, deerhounds can also have an allergic reaction to certain drugs and antibiotics due to metabolism issues. Sometimes a certain blood vessel in the liver, which should close in puppies, doesn\u2019t close. The breeder should identify this, and surgery can correct it. Dogs with the deep-chested physique of the deerhound sometimes suffer from this disorder. Multiple small meals a day, a lower fat diet, and avoiding strenuous exercise immediately before and after eating can reduce this tendency. Immediate treatment from a vet is recommended if the dog shows signs of bloat, such as restlessness, vomiting, or a swollen or hard stomach. The Scottish deerhound exhibits a refined personality. Composed, gentle, and respectful, the deerhound is friendly and eager to please. Its playful and affectionate traits make it good around other dogs, its family, and children, though its size can make it a bit intimidating for small kids. It is a gentle giant that likes to play and is calm with strangers. No wonder it is the \u201cRoyal Dog of Scotland.\u201d The Scottish deerhound\u2019s short, wiry coat needs to be brushed and combed every few weeks. You can bathe the dog occasionally to reduce any odor. Also, trim its nails every few weeks to keep them from splintering or cracking. Inspect the deerhound\u2019s skin, eyes, and ears whenever grooming is done, to head off any problems. Brush the deerhound\u2019s teeth at least two to three times a week. The Scottish deerhound\u2019s training should begin at a young age to avoid any bad habits which will need to be corrected later. The dog is very sensitive and responds well to positive reinforcement, as well as a generally upbeat tone of voice. Also, they don\u2019t enjoy extended repetition of tasks; once they learn something, they\u2019re ready to move on. The deerhound\u2019s tendency to chase means that it should be handled on a lead or in an enclosed area with a high fence. It doesn\u2019t do well in a kennel or crate and needs companionship, preferably of another deerhound, and exercise. A companion deerhound will help you to exercise this breed properly. With another dog and a large fenced-in area to play, the deerhound can run to its heart\u2019s content. Since they can\u2019t be left crated all day, puppies and dogs need to be able to exercise and run. Older hounds, though they are content to lie on the couch, need to be encouraged to exercise because it\u2019s good for them. They tend to get stir crazy and their fitness needs to be a priority through old age. As with most dogs, deerhounds should be socialized from a young age. Puppy kindergarten can begin as soon as vaccinations are complete, though lack of shots shouldn\u2019t stop you from introducing your pup to members of the family, friends, other (large) household pets, and children as soon as you bring him or her home. If your pup is being destructive, that may mean that it is not getting enough attention and exercise, though forcing it to run alongside a bike should be avoided until it has reached about 18 months of development. The deerhound actually grows more slowly than many large breed dogs, requiring unique dietary and exercise approaches. They do well with children, but their size can lead to some issues with small children; such a massive dog can be intimidating, and a child may be apprehensive about being in the presence of an animal that large. The deerhound should be socialized with children from a young age, and it is best if you do not let the dog play with very small children unattended. The children should also be taught how to interact properly with a dog and read its behavioral cues. However, small children should never be left unattended with a dog, trained or otherwise. Afghan hound: Despite its fancy appearance, this large member of the hound group is known as a rugged hunter. Its luxurious coat actually protects it from the elements in the mountains of Afghanistan. Borzoi: Somewhat similar in size and body type to the Scottish deerhound, the Borzoi is an elegant and speedy member of the hound group that also carries itself in a dignified manner. The Borzoi was bred to hunt wolves, which accounts for its other name of Russian wolfhound. Greyhound: The greyhound is the forbear of the Scottish deerhound. An ancient breed, this dog is the template for many large hounds throughout Europe and Asia and is known for its graceful speed and regal bearing. \u201cDusk\u201d and \u201cDawn\u201d were two Scottish deerhounds belonging to the author Karen Blixen, otherwise known as Isak Dinesen.

The Belgian Shepherd has health concerns owners want to be aware of. Avoid breeders, shops, and owners who cannot produce documentation that a dog\u2019s parents were healthy. You can have any puppy checked at the vet, but that\u2019s not a substitute for knowing your pooch is genetically healthy. Here are some health issues for this breed, many of which are common to most dogs. The Belgian Shepherd is brave, alert, smart, and loyal. While obedient, he loves freedom, staying in motion when allowed to roam. Though friendly, the dog naturally distrusts strangers. The trait makes your dog an excellent watchdog. But without proper socialization, your dog can also be aggressive. With training, the shepherd is a great protector and won\u2019t attack unprovoked. He\u2019ll be friendly with people he\u2019s familiar with, glad to share time and attention with them. It\u2019s a sound idea to get your dog socialized while it is a puppy. While scouting for a puppy, stay away from bullies or the puppy hiding in corners. Shyness can lead to socialization problems. The Belgian Shepherd is quite comfortable indoors but needs to get out. A home with a secured yard is perfect! It loves off-leash fun as well as long walks and runs. You want to make sure it gets the diet and grooming it needs too. Here\u2019s some info that will help. Belgian Shepherds need a diet rich in high-quality fats and healthy proteins. The dog is an active breed. Get a large-breed formula while monitoring its weight and condition. A freeze-dried raw kibble is a great way for your dog to get plenty of protein and fat in a less processed package for optimal digestion and energy. So, A-Z Animals picks Merrick Backcountry Raw Infused Grain Free & with Healthy Grains Dry Dog Food as the best dog food for Belgian Shepherds.

This sheepdog has a rustic, long, natural black coat that looks beautiful. It does shed heavily and mat easily, so you want to groom and maintain that coat. Get yourself a slicker brush, pin brush, or metal rake comb and work the coat for at least 20 minutes a week. Don\u2019t trim to the point where you diminish its natural appearance. Over its lifespan, the dog will shed heavily once a year. During this period, warm baths will release dead hair from the coat. Follow safety rules when clipping nails. Shave thin portions to avoid frightening or hurting the dog. Use several sessions to trim long nails. Better yet, avoid letting nails get too long. Talk with your vet or breeder about the frequency of nail clipping. The Belgian Shepher needs early, responsible socialization that it will carry over its lifespan. Owners can streamline much of this with training. Generally good with humans and very intelligent, Belgian Shepherds are highly trainable. The dog\u2019s not stubborn or willful, but it is best trained by an experienced owner or trainer. Leadership, confidence, and consistency will be important. The Belgian Shepherd has a lot of energy to burn. The pooch is capable of running in circles with glee. These canines will go after a stick and leap for a Frisbee. It will happily run and jog with loved ones. The shepherd requires at least an hour of activity a day. Divide the regimen into two or three sessions. Keep the dog busy before it finds annoying ways to busy itself. Puppy diets should prevent rapid growth. Large-breed puppy food will help. Regardless of where you get your puppy, have a contract verifying health. If you want a good buying experience, a breeder is more important than the right puppy or a good price. Once you adopt, get the puppy to a vet soon to check for visible issues. If raised alongside kids as a puppy \u2014 and trained \u2014 your Belgian Shepherd promises to be a good companion to all members of the household. But remember, these are laborer animals. Untrained, the dog uses its talents to herd children while playing. That can include aggressive pushing and even nipping to keep kids in line. Untrained dogs should never be around any child unsupervised. If you like dogs of medium size with the rustic look of the wilderness, here are a few dogs similar to the Belgian Shepherd. The first noticeable difference between the Belgian and German Shepherd is their color. The Belgian has a thick black coat while the German comes in many black, brown, and tan shades. Next is the size. The German Shepherd is going to be larger than the Belgian. The German has a double-layer coat to help keep it warm. Both dogs are bright, loyal, and great family members. The German Shepherd has a lower energy level and might be better suited for a slower lifestyle. Here are five of the most popular names for the Belgian Shepherd.",

        "Name": "Picardy Spaniel",
        "Genus": "Canis",
        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Origin": "France",
        "Behavior": "They can be characterized as social.Their aggression level is low.",
        "Features": "Brown roan coat",
        "Fun_Fact": "Picardy spaniels are one of the few working dogs that do well in apartments as long as they get their long walks every day.",
        "Text": "The Picardy spaniel is a medium-sized hunting dog with all the typical features of other working spaniels, like their expressive eyes, silky ears, and sturdy build. However, something that sets them apart from the rest is their brown roan coat with tan markings. Picardy spaniels were initially bred for hunting by French noblemen, and while today, they are primarily companion dogs, there are still people who use them as gun dogs to retrieve prey like waterfowl and hares . This is such a rare breed, and therefore, there is only one other type of Picardy spaniel: the Blue Picardy spaniel . The Blue Picardy spaniel is the result of crossbreeding the English Setter and Picardy spaniel. This breed is exceptionally cute, but before running out and purchasing one, there are a few pros and cons about the Picardy spaniel you need to know about: Because this is a medium-sized breed, it should be fed high-quality dog food formulated especially for dogs of its size. In addition, because they are working dogs, try looking for kibble designed to meet their needs . The Picardy spaniel is similar in size to their cousin, the Cocker spaniel . Their weight ranges from 40 to 55 pounds and they grow 12 to 14 inches tall. In addition, female Picardy spaniels are typically smaller than males. These dogs are generally healthy and have relatively long lifespans . However, one major health issue in Picardy spaniels is ear infections because of the shape and size of their long ears. In addition, they are prone to obesity if overfed and understimulated. Picardy spaniels can live for 12 to 14 years of age. These dogs are mild-mannered and highly intelligent. Even though they were bred to be hunting dogs, they make fantastic family pets. Of course, they need plenty of outdoor space to release all their pent-up energy. However, Picardy spaniels are one of the few working dogs that do well in apartments as long as they get their long walks every day. They are so devoted to their family that they may develop separation anxiety if left alone the whole day. To avoid behavioral problems, ensure that they get enough exercise and attention each day. Picardy spaniels usually have a relatively long lifespan, but that is only if they are cared for correctly. So, before obtaining this breed, be sure you can keep up with all its care requirements. This breed usually experiences matting on their ears, legs, and tails, which can be prevented by brushing them twice a week, focusing on those areas. In addition, their ears require a lot of attention because they are prone to ear infections . Therefore, they will benefit from a thorough ear cleaning every week with a veterinary-approved ear cleaner. These dogs require consistent training with a firm leader because they are a stubborn breed. However, they are very intelligent and should follow instructions easily with a positive reinforcement training method. In addition, they are busybodies and generally excel at many dog sports, even ones that don\u2019t require fetching skills. These dogs will not respond well to yelling or physical punishment, which only scares them and may impact the bond between the dog and owner. These dogs are incredibly active and have high exercise needs . Their stamina and endurance are out of this world, and they can go for long daily jogs without even breaking a sweat. In fact, a daily jog won\u2019t be enough for this hunting dog. They need over 2 hours of exercise a day, including running around in an enclosed yard. The average litter size for this breed is between 6 to 8 puppies. Pups can be quite rambunctious because of their high energy level, so it\u2019s best to start socialization and training from an early age. Socialization does wonders for these puppies as it will teach them to be calmer and friendlier towards other animals and people. In addition, training will stop any destructive behavior and keep their energy levels under control. Because Picardy spaniels are somewhat rare, finding one is difficult. Hopeful dog lovers are usually placed on a waiting list and can spend between $900 to $1,200 for a pup. Picardy spaniels are the perfect family dog. Their high energy levels work well with young children, and their hunting dog background makes them excellent watchdogs who will covet your children. In addition, if socialized from a young age, they get along well with other pets. There are many dog breeds similar to the Picardy spaniel. The following breeds are all water dogs and have very gentle and loving natures: Picardy spaniels are such gorgeous dogs you have to find a name to match.

        "Name": "Shetland Sheep Dog",
        "Genus": "Canis",
        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Origin": "Shetland, United Kingdom",
        "Behavior": "They usually live in packs. Their temperament can be characterized as bright, energetic, loyal, affectionate, intelligent and playful.Their aggression level is low.",
        "Fun_Fact": "Shetland Sheepdogs are one of the most successful breeds at obedience trials.",
        "Text": "The Shetland Sheepdog is a lovable bundle of energy. This tiny member of the herding group was bred in the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland to herd sheep , ponies, and poultry. They bred it to be small due to the spartan conditions of the island and the cost of feeding a larger dog . The stock used to breed the dog is unknown, and the breed is somewhat shrouded in mystery, but there was a reference to the little bundles of fur in the early 19th century. Vocal, full of energy, and playfulness, this dog is an excellent breed for a family pet, especially if energetic children are around to play with the dog. This dog wants and needs your attention! The Sheltie, as it is affectionately called, is smart and obedient and excels at competitive dog activities, too. This dog learns commands quickly and is fun to train . Shetland Sheepdogs are one of the most successful breeds at obedience trials. The Shetland Sheepdog has high energy needs and should have a high protein diet. Dry dog food should have meat as the number one ingredient, and that\u2019s why we at A-Z Animals recommend Hill\u2019s Science Diet Adult Small Paws Chicken Meal . A Shetland Sheepdog is a small herding dog, with males reaching a height of 13-16 inches at the shoulder and weighing 15-25 pounds. The females are slightly smaller. While the Shetland Sheepdog is a generally healthy dog, there are some issues that a potential owner should check with the breeder about. Dogs may sometimes be at risk for a variety of conditions: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Shelties have been known to suffer from some eye disorders, namely Collie eye anomaly (CEA), which is specific to collies and related dogs, and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). CEA is a hereditary disorder. It is present at birth but may not be diagnosed until later. Physical indicators include small, deep-set eyes. There is no cure, but the disease is not progressive and will not worsen over time. This disease can be screened for, as a recently developed DNA test exists. The other disorder, PRA, is also hereditary. This doesn\u2019t typically show up until the age of 2 years. PRA is progressive. After onset, the end result is total blindness. There is also a DNA test for this disorder. Dermatomyositis is a rare genetic disorder that sometimes affects Shelties at around 4-6 months of age. It initially shows as hair loss on the top of the head, around the eyes, along the forearms, and at the tip of the tail. If it progresses without treatment, it can result in fatal damage to the nervous system. Although it is a genetic disorder, there is currently no test, only an extensive analysis of bloodlines. Another potential hazard is Von Willebrand disease. This is a bleeding disorder for which a DNA test is available. Shelties are also prone to a certain type of bladder cancer and hip dysplasia. The Shetland Sheepdog is known for its energetic, lovable, happy-go-lucky personality. Its herding traits give it a lot of energy and a personality that just wants to please its master. It wants to be with its owner all of the time and can be like a \u201cshadow\u201d going from task to task. It\u2019s usually on its best behavior unless it is ignored or bored, and it is great with kids. The Sheltie has a long, double coat of hair. This coat serves two functions: it is water-repellant, and it can regulate the dog\u2019s body temperature. This long coat sheds all of the time, in clumps, mostly, and should be brushed regularly but not shaved. Check for mats of fur behind the ears, elbows, and hindquarters below the tail. Only bathe this dog occasionally. Besides coat care, check the dog\u2019s ears for buildup, brush its teeth , and clip its nails regularly. Begin training and socialization early with the puppies. The Sheltie loves learning new tasks, and a consistent and organized training regimen will help get the dog acclimated and keep it mentally challenged. These dogs love agility training and excel at it. They are very quick to learn and will do well with short, positive training sessions. They really love to bark, and spending the time to train them to stop barking on command is well worth it. They are high-energy dogs and benefit from a lot of activity and playtime. Just including them in daily activities can sometimes be enough to meet these energy needs. They also love to be engaged in doggy sports, which provides an effective outlet. The puppy stage is a good time to screen for certain genetic disorders. It is also an excellent time to housebreak, obedience train, and socialize your Sheltie. Puppy Kindergarten is an excellent way to work on some of those social skills. Shetland Sheepdogs are excellent with children. They are gentle and can play for hours, using their energy and the kids\u2019. They are not aggressive and bond very closely with their children. Australian Shepherd : A somewhat larger herding dog than the Shetland Sheepdog, the Australian Shepherd is also fun-loving and affectionate. Border Collie : The Border Collie is an excellent herder and is one of the few dogs that can boast a higher intelligence than the Sheltie. Collie : This sweet and loyal dog comes from the same part of the world as the Sheltie and may even be a part of its ancestry. The Collie is great with kids and also very intelligent.

        "Text": "Images of these dogs have appeared in ancient Norse artwork. Besides that honor, these dogs also made their way into early Viking legends. Norwegian Elkhounds are one of the oldest dog breeds in Europe , perhaps in existence for thousands of years. They were used as hunting and guard dogs by the Vikings. Not a Hound, despite the name, they are part of the Spitz group. In Norwegian, \u201celg\u201d means moose and \u201chund\u201d means any dog. So they may have helped hunt elk, but they were more commonly used to hunt moose. They can smell game from over a mile away. See all of our expert product reviews . These dogs are agile, alert, and always ready for adventures with their families. In addition to being fun family companions, they are also accomplished watchdogs. Further, they are part of the Hound group and were favorite hunting companions for the Vikings. These dogs are always ready to join any adventure. They are sensitive to their owners, yet strongly independent. The dogs are perfect for family activities and have a longer lifespan. Although there are no hybrid varieties of this breed, there are several color options from black to silver that help provide various looks. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The Norwegian Elkhound is considered a medium-sized dog, with male height averaging 20 inches and female height averaging 19 inches. The average weight is 55 lbs. for males and 48 lbs. for females. The size is consistent with the average lifespan. This breed has a few health issues that can come at a high price to treat. Hip dysplasia is one of the most common health issues that these dogs live with, a painful condition affecting mobility. Progressive retinal atrophy is a condition that can affect the eyes. Norwegian Elkhounds may also be susceptible to autoimmune hypothyroidism. Fanconi syndrome , a type of kidney disease, and skin cysts are also conditions that these dogs are vulnerable to. Getting a dog from a responsible breeder that screens for problems with the heart and eyes may help decrease the chances of your pet developing these problems. In short, the most common health issues that Norwegian Elkhounds face are: See all of our expert product reviews . From the time they are puppies, this breed is naturally extroverted, independent, protective, and loyal. These dogs are always happy to be in on the action, with a temperament that embodies its fun-loving nature and a mischievous gleam in its eyes. This breed has a strong independent streak, which can make training a little bit tricky at times. Norwegian Elkhounds are protective, not letting even perceived threats bother their families without a fight. Although not aggressive, they have a bark that is usually enough to encourage a would-be intruder to stay away. These dogs are loyal to their families, without question, and develop strong bonds with all family members. There are several important considerations for new Norwegian Elkhound owners to keep in mind, regardless of whether they have dogs from a breeder or rescue dogs. Breed-specific issues may range from maintaining an ideal weight to whether a black coat color requires special care to which conditions your vet should screen for in the dog during exams. Norwegian Elkhounds, including puppies and adults of all lifespan stages, have unique needs because of their playful nature. The food that you pick will need to address the dog\u2019s individual needs ranging from its teeth to its coat. At periodic appointments, collaborate with your vet to come up with the ideal diet for your dog. This breed can exhibit kidney disease, in which case, many vets recommend low-phosphorus dog food. Puppy food: Puppies of this breed thrive on diets with a high ratio of amino acids for a stronger immune system. Foods rich in protein help their muscles grow strong. Lean meats, such as fish or chicken, can help easily meet growing puppies\u2019 needs, especially for healthy teeth and bones. Adult dog food: Foods high in amino acids and protein will be necessary for adults as well. Hybrid blends of freeze-dried meat and dry food are among some of the most popular food types. Any food that these dogs eat should have meat as the first ingredient. At A-Z Animals, we feel the best dog food for Norwegian Elkhounds is Farmina Natural & Delicious Ocean Ancestral Grain Cod & Orange Adult Medium & Maxi Dog Food. This recipe is a perfect match for this breed, not just because it contains Scandinavian herring, but because of its full nutritional profile. Using fish as a source of protein, the formula includes glucosamine for resilient joints, and taurine and beta-carotene, both of which promote healthy eyes. Here\u2019s where you can get Farmina N&D Ocean Ancestral Grain and Cod dog food on Chewy or Amazon. Norwegian Elkhounds do not shed much but blow their coats two or three times yearly, often leading to clumps of black or silver hair around the house. Brushing once or twice a week and bathing the dog every six months will help keep the coat clean. Dog brushes with stiff bristles will get through the dog\u2019s hair quickly. Aside from skin cysts, these dogs generally have no significant coat or skin conditions. These dogs are very intelligent, with a strong independent streak. However, they are relatively easy to train when using reward-based methods. Treats are some of the most popular rewards. Norwegian Elkhounds require vigorous activity daily because of their natural energy level. Because of the breed\u2019s activity level and loud bark, these dogs are better suited to houses with yards than to apartments. At least a walk a day is recommended. Running shorter distances in enclosed areas and playing fetch are examples of activities that are ideal for these dogs, including hybrid activities like combining fetch with a good long run. Although not as common in rescue as many other breeds, finding a Norwegian Elkhound puppy through a rescue is possible. Because these dogs are so high-energy, they are often a poor fit for people without the time to devote to the dog\u2019s training. These puppies, in particular, love to get their teeth on anything within easy reach. Sometimes, owners who acquire one of these dogs are unwilling to devote the time to training or pay the price of a trainer. Although these are loyal family dogs, they are not necessarily suited to people of all ages. These dogs are often somewhat rough in their play, increasing the chances of injuring a small child. The breed does best with older children and teens. Similar dog breeds to the Norwegian Elkhound include the Finnish Spitz, German Spitz, and Japanese Spitz. The most famous Norwegian Elkhound was President Herbert Hoover\u2019s dog, Weeje, who lived with him at the White House during the 1930s. An \u201cX-Files\u201d episode mentions a Norwegian Elkhound that a character owns. The breed also appears in When Christ and His Saints Slept by Sharon Kay Penman and Orlando: A Biography by Virginia Woolf.",

        "Name": "Greyhound",
        "Genus": "Canis",
        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Text": "The greyhound is the fastest breed of dog , and retired racing greyhounds make for calm and sweet pets. The greyhound has the highest percentage of fast-twitch muscle of any breed. In spite of this reputation, retired racing greyhounds make for calm and sweet pets. It is also called the English greyhound to avoid confusion with the Italian greyhound . Since its breed registration in 1885 by the American Kennel Club, it has enjoyed a following as a friendly, noble sporting show dog and pet. See all of our expert product reviews . The breed is a hunting type and a sighthound whose ancient remains were discovered in modern Syria and dated 4,000 years ago. Originally, however, it was used for hunting desert wildlife by the Egyptian pharaohs 5,000 years ago and depictions of the dogs have been found in their tombs. It has a history in coursing of deer , foxes , and hare , and racing and companionship in England, Great Britain, and the British Isles. Greyhounds feature in Greek and Roman mythology and are the only dog mentioned in the Bible. They have long been associated with royalty and aristocracy. During the Dark Ages, they nearly became extinct due to famine but were saved by priests, who bred them for the nobility. King Canute, who ruled England from 1016 to 1035, enacted a law lasting almost 400 years that owning a greyhound was a right exclusive to noblemen, who often used them in hunting and coursing. Due to their speed and agility, the breed was used for dog races, with greyhound racing reaching its peak in the 19th century in England and the 20th century in America. Owing to the cruelty of greyhound racing, including overbreeding, these days it is legal in only a handful of countries and a few states in the U.S. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our expert product reviews . This dog is tall, slim, graceful, and a smooth-coated large dog with powerful, long legs under a deep chest, flexible spine and slender build. They have a height of 28-30 inches for males and 27-28 inches for females. Males weigh 60-88 lbs and females weigh 55-75 lbs. They both weigh on average about 70 lbs. Most greyhounds in family homes today are adopted as adult racing dogs. They are considered adults at 18 months. Greyhounds tend to be healthy and to live long lives of 10-14 years. However, there have been some cases of greyhounds developing esophageal achalasia, gastric dilatation volvulus (also called bloat), gastric torsion, heart and eye conditions, osteosarcoma, and corns on the paw pads. There is also a condition called greyhound neuropathy. They can develop Alabama rot if exposed to E. coli. If they are on hard surfaces, they develop skin sores. Flea collars, flea spray, and other insecticides are not safe to use on them. If they are outside, they will have more health issues from exposure to extreme heat or cold, though they tolerate heat better than cold. Some racing greyhounds develop an arched back \u2014 while they run, they extend their long legs and stretch their spines for a better stride to cover more ground in less time. An arched back makes it impossible for them to do so, although some dogs can run very fast. Recommended health tests for the breed are an ophthalmologist evaluation, a greyhound polyneuropathy NDRG1 DNA test , and a cardiac exam. In sum, common health issues with this breed are: Notably, Greyhounds are docile, quiet, gentle, and loving pets. They each have their own personality, with different traits and behavior depending on whether they were purely show or working dogs. Although many adopted greyhounds are retired racing dogs, they adjust very well as adults to their new homes. They don\u2019t tend to bark or howl, but they are mistrustful of strangers. When they are not sprinting outside, they are couch potatoes at home, mostly relaxing or sleeping for 18 hours a day. However, it is difficult for them to be left alone for several hours, as they need a lot of attention and care. That\u2019s because they enjoy being around people and other pets. As puppies, they are more demanding than adults, with a need for playtime of 1 to 2 hours a day. Likewise, they need chew toys to learn not to mouth on people. The most important decision in adopting a greyhound is whether it should be a puppy or an adult because they are different in their needs and behavior. From there, new pet owners can learn about how to care for these dogs at various ages. The breed also has unique health factors that must be considered. Most importantly, greyhounds demand a diet higher in fat, calories, and protein than some other dogs. More specifically, they need high-quality dog food for their age. Also, since this breed can be prone to heart issues, stay educated about the link between legumes in dog food and heart failure, and think about looking for legume-free dog food. At first, puppies enjoy puppy kibble and pureed meat. Later, to meet the dietary needs of adults, feed them a mixture of dry food and chopped meat. In particular, they need 250-300g of meat a day. Like other pets, you should remember what human foods are safe for them to eat. Some examples of greyhound-safe fruit are bananas, apples, oranges, and watermelons. Also, vegetables they can eat are carrots, green beans, zucchini, cucumber, and cooked potato. Additionally, they can eat rice and pasta. In our opinion at A-Z Animals, Victor Super Premium Dog Food \u2013 Performance Dry Dog Food \u2013 26% Protein is the best dog food for Greyhounds. With beef and chicken, this recipe delivers vital taurine that keeps the heart ticking and the eyes sharp. It\u2019s expert-formulated with amino acids, omegas, and probiotics for immune system defense and balanced skin. You can buy Victor Super Premium Dog Food on Chewy or Amazon. The best insurance for your greyhound is a plan that allows them to see any vet, emergency clinic or specialist in the country. Importantly, it should have unlimited or no restrictions on coverage. Also, keep in mind that some insurance companies have exclusions for performance dogs. This breed\u2019s short coat goes through light seasonal shedding. It needs no more than a monthly bath and weekly rubdown with a damp cloth or grooming glove. Secondly, nails should be trimmed and ears cleaned regularly. Finally, you should brush their teeth every day with a special toothpaste formulated for dogs. Greyhounds are playful and have a lot of wanderlust, but they are very smart and easy to train as adults. As puppies, they are more difficult to train since they have difficulty with recall. Like other sighthounds, they have a very strong prey drive and therefore tend to give chase, being able to see far ahead. When you practice letting them go off-lead in a safe area, they will remember to come back. It becomes easier as they get older. Greyhounds enjoy sprinting, with an average high speed of 45 mph. Part of their exercise is mental stimulation, so they could enjoy games or hidden treats. Other than a daily walk, they need an additional 30-40 minutes of exercise each day. They do well living in apartments if they get to be walked. If there is no yard, they will require more frequent walking. To burst off excess energy, greyhounds sprint in the backyard or through the house. Walk them in the early morning and evening to avoid sunburn, and wait an hour after feeding them before playing to avoid bloat or torsion. Puppies are born in litters of 1-12. Like most breeds, during puppyhood greyhounds express mouthiness and the tendency to chew on, nip, or play-bite. Mouthy dogs tend to use their mouths to hold or \u201cherd\u201d humans, so they need to learn to redirect to chew toys. Like other mouthy breeds, greyhounds love to play fetch, and they also enjoy chewing on stimulating and rewarding toys stuffed with kibble or treats. This breed needs a lot of attention and training during puppyhood. Greyhounds need to be socialized from a young age with other animals and children. Although very people-oriented, the breed prefers quiet and soft-spoken families rather than a family that has very young children. Their skin tears easily, making it difficult for them to be around rowdy toddlers. Rather, they are independent while playing, being more self-motivated than other hunting breeds that require direction. The English greyhound belongs to the sighthound group, which includes other dogs that carry the greyhound name. These types of greyhounds, such as the Italian Greyhound and Scottish Greyhound, are separate breeds closely related to the English greyhound in appearance, temperament and traditional use as a hunting dog. The most popular names for greyhounds refer to their speed. For either sex, the top five names are:",

        "Text": "Bull terriers are high-energy, strong dogs known for their friendliness and persistence. Bull terriers have an independent streak which can make them challenging to train. This dog has a sad history that dates back to 13th century Britain. A group of dogs would participate in a sporting or blood sports competition known as bullbaiting. The dogs were released to attack a bull while observers bet on the winning dog. Later in the early 1800s, this dog was put into fierce dogfighting competitions held in a pit or cellar below a tavern. These dogs are sometimes referred to as pit bulls. See all of our expert product reviews . Despite its violent history in these sporting activities, the bull terrier is a friendly dog with a playful nature. It\u2019s loyal and serves as an excellent companion and guard dog. Another type of bull terrier , called the White Cavalier, was a favorite with royalty in the 1860s. It\u2019s notable for its all-white coat of fur. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . It is quite ironic that some of the most friendly dog breeds today were initially bred and used for a much less pleasant purpose. This is the case with Bull Terriers, which were originally used in a barbaric sport known as bull-baiting. This practice, which involved Bulldogs attacking a staked bull while onlookers bet on the outcome, was popular in Britain from the 13th century onward. Fortunately, blood sports with animals were outlawed in the 1830s, but these cruel events still continued to take place in secret. Dogfighting then became the new preferred blood sport, with dogs being made to fight each other in indoor pits, often in the cellars of pubs. In order to make the cruel sport of dog fighting more entertaining, Bulldogs were mixed with Terriers to bring together the strength of a Bulldog and the energy and enthusiasm of a Terrier. This led to the creation of the Bull Terrier. See all of our expert product reviews . In the mid-1800s, when pit fighting was outlawed in Britain, Bull Terriers found themselves out of a job. But breeders saw the opportunity and quickly worked to refine their appearance and demeanor, making them ideally suited to be the perfect pet for the upper class. In the 1860s, James Hinks, an Englishman, took an old breed of fighting dogs, which was a cross between a Bulldog and a Terrier, and improved it to become the Bull Terrier of today. Initially, the breed was only white, but in the early 1900s, versions with colors began to appear. This breed was accepted into the American Kennel Club in 1885 and quickly became popular in the United States. Some famous Bull Terriers include General George Patton\u2019s Willy, Rufus, who won Westminster in 2006, and Bullseye, who is the mascot for Target. This is a short-haired breed that\u2019s medium in size. Males grow to be 22 inches tall while females are 21 inches tall at the withers. A fully grown male weighs up to 65 pounds, whereas a fully grown female weighs as much as 55 pounds. A seven-week-old puppy weighs around 20 pounds. A standard bull terrier is fully grown at 19 months, while a miniature is fully grown at 16 months old. The biggest bull terrier on record weighed 110 pounds. As with all dog breeds, bull terriers have some common health issues. Heart disease is one example. It takes the form of a weakened heart valve. Kidney disease is another common health issue in this breed. Kidney disease happens when protein leaks from a dog\u2019s kidneys. A special diet can help with this condition. Some bull terriers also deal with patellar luxation. This is when a dog\u2019s kneecap moves out of place, causing the dog to limp. Sometimes the kneecap can pop back into the proper position on its own. Other times, the dog may need surgery. The most common health issues of this breed include: Standard bull terriers, as well as miniature bull terriers, are known for their playful personality. They are strong dogs that like to play frisbee, fetch, and chase. These dogs are known for high-energy behavior, such as running, jumping, digging, and more. This makes them ideal for dog sporting and agility events where they are being timed. One thing to keep in mind about bull terriers is they can be aggressive if not socialized and provided with thorough obedience training. This dog has a strong personality and needs to know what type of behavior is expected of it. One of its most impressive traits is loyalty. They make great companions for adults or older children. Learning about the specific dietary needs, exercise requirements, and grooming routine of bull terriers can help an owner take the best possible care of their pet. Plus, choosing the right type of food for a puppy or adult bull terrier can help to prevent some of their most common health issues. Of course, puppies need a different type of diet than grown bull terriers. For puppies, protein is the first nutrient to look for in their food. Amino acids in protein contribute to strengthening the dog\u2019s muscular body. This can promote healthy growth of the knees to prevent patellar luxation. Also, protein supports healthy skin and hair. Calcium supports the growth of healthy bones and teeth. Vitamins E and C contribute to healthy kidney growth in a puppy. Protein plays an important part in the diet of an adult bull terrier as well. Protein, along with a controlled amount of fat, gives this dog energy to support its various activities. Controlling the fat in an adult dog\u2019s diet can help to prevent heart disease. Calcium contributes to healthy bones and teeth in adult dogs. This can prevent dental issues. Vitamin E and C can help guard against kidney disease. Vitamin A supports the healthy vision of this dog. Steer clear of dog foods containing legumes so you don\u2019t exacerbate this breed\u2019s risk of heart disease. Some vets will point owners towards low-phosphorus dog foods if their companion suffers from kidney disease. Stay in contact with your vet about your Bull Terrier\u2019s health and follow their food recommendations.

This dog requires weekly brushing. A soft brush with boar\u2019s hair bristles is a quality grooming tool for a bull terrier\u2019s coat. A grooming glove can be used to groom the dog\u2019s legs and face to remove loose or dead hair. It\u2019s most effective to start at the dog\u2019s head and move toward its tail. This routine is appropriate for both standard bull terriers and miniature bull terriers. A good grooming routine keeps a bull terrier\u2019s coat glossy and gives an owner the chance to bond with this dog. A White Cavalier terrier needs a grooming routine that\u2019s a little more time-consuming. This dog, with its pure white coat, needs to be bathed more often to keep its hair looking clean and glossy. Bull terriers can develop red, itchy patches of skin due to food or seasonal allergies. Asking a veterinarian about the dog\u2019s diet and testing for seasonal allergies can help to clear up this condition. Bull terriers are intelligent dogs, but they have an independent nature. This can make training challenging if an owner doesn\u2019t go about it the right way. Words of praise are helpful in keeping this dog focused. Making the lessons fun with delicious treats is also very effective with this breed. A border collie is another intelligent dog, but it\u2019s easier to train than a bull terrier because it doesn\u2019t have an independent streak. Whether an owner has a miniature or standard bull terrier, this dog needs exercise every day. This pup has a lot of energy that it needs to burn off in order to stay healthy. It needs at least 40 minutes of exercise each day. Running, jumping, fetching a ball, playing chase, or catching a frisbee are all activities that provide a bull terrier with great exercise. It\u2019s not a good idea to take this dog to a dog park. Generally, bull terriers don\u2019t get along with other dogs. Bull terriers are muscular dogs that are fast and like to keep moving. They need a large living space. So they are not recommended for apartment living. A medium to large fenced-in backyard is a great place for a bull terrier to stretch its legs.

So, feeding a puppy the right amount of food is just as crucial as feeding it a nutritional diet. Bull terriers aren\u2019t an advisable choice for families with small children.

        "Name": "Maremma Sheepdog",
        "Genus": "Canis",
        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Text": "It\u2019s a breed with many names: the Maremmano, the Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdog, the Cane da Pastore Abruzzese, and as we\u2019ll call it here, the Maremma Sheepdog. This fluffy herding dog is native to its namesake Abruzzo region and the Maremma marshlands of Italy, where it guarded sheep against predator wolves. Maremma Sheepdogs are still abundant, though they\u2019re used less often in sheep farming. They share a common ancestor with the Great Pyrenees, featuring a fluffy white coat and a sharp intelligence bred to work independently and with their owners. This intelligence may make them trickier to train, but with the right tactics, you can earn this dog\u2019s respect and enjoy its partnership for many years. Read on to learn more about the Maremma Sheepdog and everything you need to know before considering adoption. Maremmas require a nutrient-dense, balanced diet to keep them in good physical condition and healthy and energetic order. Regular mealtimes \u2013 usually twice a day \u2013 with consistent food measurements are a must to prevent obesity. You should adjust this measurement in tandem with your pup\u2019s exercise and lifestyle. It\u2019s also easy to overfeed them during their growing years, which can contribute to hip dysplasia and other musculature or joint-related issues, so consult your vet to determine the best serving sizes for your pup. A balanced dry food with plenty of Calcium, Phosphorus, and at least 22% protein content will help provide your Maremma Sheepdog the diet he needs to thrive. Plenty of fats will keep coats shiny and healthy and help bones, teeth, and hair stay strong. As such, the A-Z Animals team recommends Hill Science Diet Dried Dog Food for Adult Large Dogs . This formula features: The Maremma Sheepdog female\u2019s average height ranges between 25 and 28 inches, with males capable of growing about three inches taller. Males can weigh up to 100 pounds when fully grown, and females weigh about 85 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . On average, Maremma Sheepdogs are generally healthy and have no common or genetic health issues. Preventative vaccines and vet-recommend boosters protect them from influenza and infections such as heart- or tapeworms. These larger, mobile dogs can sometimes develop hip dysplasia later in life. It\u2019s important to only purchase a Maremma Sheepdog from a breeder who can provide a certification that your dog\u2019s parents are free from hip dysplasia. Feeding them a consistent, moderate diet will also help prevent bloat and symptoms from weight-related health issues. Maremmas were bred as sheep and personal protection animals and, as such, turn to their owners for directions. They thrive when provided responsibility and can become anxious or aggressive without a purpose. They are independent, brilliant pups and, without proper guidance or training, can make up their own minds about whether a mail carrier is a friend or thief, for example. Proper socialization early in life, combined with disciplined and positive training, will help assert you as the leader of the pack and put your Maremma\u2019s mind at ease. Maremma Sheepdogs are fluffy, beautiful dogs requiring moderate grooming levels and attentive, positive-reinforcement training. While not recommended for first-time dog owners, a dedicated trainer can earn a Maremma\u2019s trust and enjoy the benefits of an intelligent, loyal companion for years to come. Maremmas sport dense, fluffy undercoats that shed seasonally in the spring and autumn. They can go a long time without grooming or a bath if constantly exposed to wind and weather. However, dogs that live mostly indoors may require more baths and regular brushing to keep them in good shape. Be sure to check your dog\u2019s ears for dirt or debris regularly, file nails to prevent breakage, and brush teeth routinely. House- and obedience training your Maremma will go quickly with regular, short sessions and lots of positive reinforcement. Puppies can learn tricks as early as four or five months, and training treats and plenty of encouragement will help them associate obedience with affection and praise. Maremma Sheepdogs can also be trained to compete in agility and obedience competitions, given their intelligence and eagerness to please. Maremma\u2019s are sheep guarders rather than sheep herders, so they don\u2019t require quite as much exercise as their shepherd companions. However, they should be walked at least twice daily for 45-60 minutes to keep them from becoming overweight or developing bloat. Maremmas also loves long walks or hikes and generally keeping their owners company on longer outdoor adventures. Maremma Sheepdog puppies require heavy and consistent socialization from a very early age, as soon as their vaccinations allow. Allow your pup to constantly meet other dogs and get used to being handled by friendly strangers. This continual stimulation will help prevent your dog from becoming anxious or over-protective of its family. Even then, Maremmas insist on being correctly introduced to newcomers to the house. Crate training will provide your pup a safe space to call their own and help get them used to confinement if the situation requires it. The Maremma Sheepdog is a big fan of children and babies and enjoys playing with well-behaved kids. They will follow their charges around the house and happily lean into or hug children during play or rest. However, Maremmas can sometimes overprotect their families and may object to strangers\u2019 kids being overtly physical with their charges. Take care to supervise play between your Maremma and children and to properly teach kids to treat a dog with respect before introducing them to your pup. The fluffy Maremma Sheepdog is closely related to the Great Pyrenees, the Komondor, and the Anatolian. Popular names for Maremma Sheepdog dogs include:",

The bloodhound is thought to be the oldest hound still around that utilizes scent to hunt and is seen as a predecessor to breeds like the black and tan coonhound and related coonhound varieties. Around one thousand years ago, bloodhounds were developed in Western Europe, and the credit for their careful breeding is given to high-ranking members of the pre-Reformation church. During medieval times many influential members of the church kept packs of hounds on the grounds of monasteries in England and France.

While this breed originates in Sweden, it dates back to the 8th century to the time when the Vikings conquered areas of Britain and is similar to the Welsh corgi which is why it is also referred to as the \u201cwolf corgi\u201d. The Vallhund was intended to be a farm dog, to herd cattle, and almost went extinct in the 1940s. These are small herding dogs with short legs, pointed ears, and a thick coat of medium-length fur.

The Swedish Vallhund was originally bred to be a cow dog, so expect your pet to be alert, interactive, and great with group interactions. They may have a hard time getting along with particularly small animals due to their slightly raised prey drive. Many people see these dogs as guard dogs.

Plan to brush your Vallhund frequently to maintain the condition of their coat. Make sure not to get a brush that snags on their fur; instead, look for something that pulls through smoothly, especially at the thickest parts of the coat. If you live in a moderate or warm climate, make sure that your Vallhund goes to the groomer in the summertime to get their undercoat trimmed. You should also make sure to regularly trim your Vallhund\u2019s nails and check on the condition of their eyes, ears, and nose. Swedish Vallhunds are incredibly intelligent and have great training potential. They have no problems learning tricks and simple tasks. They also have a strong herding potential that only needs to be lightly reinforced. Vallhunds have the potential to be jumpy and wary of strangers, so they do better when they are socialized correctly as puppies. Expect your Vallhund to want to greet and interact with guests, and teach them healthy ways to express their general excitement and engagement. Swedish Vallhunds are high-energy dogs and need as much exercise as they can get. Expect to take your Vallhund on at least two walks a day. Vallhunds like to play, and they\u2019re happiest in houses with room for moving around. A Swedish Vallhund can easily be an apartment dog if they are taken outside regularly and given plenty of attention by their owners. Vallhunds are herding dogs, so they thrive under an incredibly active lifestyle if they are given the opportunity. These dogs are particularly popular on farms and in other environments where they can safely be brought with their owners. Swedish Vallhund puppies are eager to get moving in life. Be aware that most Vallhund puppies go through a nipping phase, meaning they will need guidance as they learn to socialize with other dogs and people. In addition to nipping, you can also expect to see chewing and other immature but interactive behaviors. Otherwise, Swedish Vallhund puppies are easy to raise and adapt well to most environments. Make sure to feed them a balanced diet with plenty of protein to encourage their long-term health. These are friendly dogs that do well in group environments. Well-trained Vallhunds get along well with children and do well as members of domestic families. However, it\u2019s not a good idea to let a child train a Vallhund puppy on their own, especially if they\u2019ve never had a dog before. Swedish Vallhunds are great dogs, but they can be hard to find in some areas. If you\u2019re looking for another playful and interactive herding dog, you should consider adopting a Finish Lapphund, a Welsh corgi, or an English Shepherd.

He intended for the breed to be a superior hunting dog that could retrieve dead game from all kinds of rugged terrain on land or water. The technical term for this type of retriever or hunter is a gundog. The result is a hardy dog breed with an impeccable and lustrous double coat of orange, golden, or light-colored fur that can tolerate cold water during hunting months and also deal with felled fowl.

The breed is also susceptible to eye disease, skin diseases, ear infections, hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormones), heart disease, and hip and elbow dysplasia (a genetic developmental abnormality in which parts of the joint grow somewhat out of alignment with each other, potentially hobbling the dog). If you intend to purchase a golden retriever, then you should be aware of the common signs of distress or illness. For instance, infections and skin allergies, which can be caused by pollens, food, and fleas, generally appear as red skin and excessive itching. For dysplasia, you may notice a limp.

In addition, when the dog is heavily shedding its double coat about once or twice a year, it may require almost daily brushes to stay clean and healthy. The best way to groom the golden retriever is to use a specialty or heavy-duty brush. The brushing can be preceded by a very rigorous bath to loosen some of the fur, but make sure the dog is dry before attempting to groom it. The nails should be trimmed on a regular basis as well. And if possible, you should regularly clean out the ears to reduce the chances of an infection. One of the breed\u2019s most appealing traits is the ease with which these dogs can be trained to perform tricks or tasks.

        "Text": "The Blue Picardy Spaniel was only recognized as a separate breed from the Picardy Spaniel in 1938. The Blue Picardy Spaniel is a medium-sized gun dog that originated from the region of northern France known as Picardy. As a descendent of the Picardy Spaniel and the English Setter , the breed\u2019s original purpose was to locate game birds in harsh terrain. The technical term for this type of dog is a spaniel: it flushes game out of the dense brush and then retrieves the prey where it has landed. Despite being a well-established purebred dog, it is not currently recognized by the American Kennel Club. It does, however, have a small but avid following in its native country of France and parts of French-speaking Canada . See all of our expert product reviews . The Blue Picardy was obviously built for hunting work. Some of the common physical characteristics include an athletic body, long muzzle, drooping ears, and a flat or wavy coat of speckled blue, almost black fur with white markings. There are extra featherings around the legs, stomach, ears, and tail as well. Blue Picardy puppies are actually born with white and black spots. The roan fur color, in which a mixture of black and white hairs combine into a sort of blue-gray appearance, only develops later as the dog starts to mature. The Blue Picardy is a medium-sized breed with an athletic and well-muscled body. Males and females are about the same size. The Blue Picardy is a very healthy dog with an average life span of around 13 years, but it is prone to developing some problems such as ear infections, cancer, ectropion (in which the lower eyelid droops down, exposing part of the eye), and a developmental disorder called hip dysplasia, in which the hip can slip loose from its socket, causing lameness and pain. Ideally, the dog should receive a certification from the vet to prove that it is free of common developmental and genetic issues. A good breeder should have already done this health certification process by themselves before the point of purchase. Once you actually bring your dog home, regular visits to the vet are essential to catch potential health problems early. In summation, these are the most common health problems: The ideal Blue Picardy is well-mannered and expressive; it isn\u2019t too aggressive or too shy. It\u2019s devoted to the family and loves playtime and companionship. Owners will need to spend a lot of time with this breed, engaging it with games, playtime, exercise, and other forms of activity. It should not be left alone by itself for long periods of time. See all of our expert product reviews . Hyperactivity and destructive behavior are usually signs of a bored dog and not deeper behavioral issues. If you need to spend a long time away from home, then you should have a plan in place for someone to take care of your dog. The Blue Picardy is a good choice for experienced and engaged owners who have the time and ability to care for a highly active dog breed. Since they require a lot of space to run around and play, the Blue Picardy is not very well-suited for apartment living . Other than that, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to care for this bred. The Blue Picardy will need a few cups of high-quality dog food per day, depending on its size, age, activity level, and other characteristics. It has no other special dietary considerations, but you should watch its calorie intake carefully to prevent it from developing obesity.

Purina ONE SmartBlend Natural High Protein dog food is available on Chewy and Amazon. The Blue Picardy will need to be brushed about once or twice a week to keep the coat smooth and healthy. During the spring and fall shedding seasons, it may need to be brushed as often as once a day. Professional grooming is not necessary, but the fur that grows around the pads and toes should be trimmed from time to time. Another important aspect of its care is the occasional toenail clipping to prevent them from cracking or clicking on the floor. Brushing the teeth with an appropriate dog-specific product will keep the teeth and gums healthy. Finally, it is a good idea to check the ears regularly for signs of infection or wax buildup. A simple cotton swab and cleaning solution will usually suffice to keep the ears healthy. The Blue Picardy is very smart, responsible, and eager to learn new things. Since it has historically worked closely with people, it should be a relative breeze to train with little of the stubbornness that may afflict other breeds. Nevertheless, since this breed does have a sensitive side, it does not respond well to harsh words or training methods. The Blue Picardy requires both support and patience from its owner. Give it enough time and space to learn at its own pace. The Blue Picardy is a highly energetic breed with great stamina and fortitude. It will probably require at least an hour of exercise per day. This breed has a strong desire to engage in vigorous running and swimming. It also excels at retrieving, agility trials, and obedience challenges. The Blue Picardy is very energetic and rambunctious as a puppy, but with enough training and socialization, the right owner can easily mold it into a mature and confident adult. Puppy kindergarten classes might be a good idea starting around 10 to 12 weeks old. You should also take your puppy to parks, playdates, and other places with lots of people and dogs. In short, you should socialize your dog early and often. Professional classes, while not strictly mandatory, can help shape your dog into a well-mannered adult. Crate training can also help puppies with housebreaking and behavioral issues. The Blue Picardy should get along exceptionally well with children of all ages. Its affectionate personality, loyal devotion, and gentle demeanor all combine to make it a great family dog. Nevertheless, adults should never leave dogs and children together unsupervised, no matter how friendly their temperament, just in case you need to intervene and stop a bad interaction. The Blue Picardy closely resembles the following types of French and English spaniels: The Blue Picardy isn\u2019t well-known outside of hunting circles in its native France.

The beagle shepherd is another hybrid breed that has emerged from the recent frenzy of designer dog creation. As is typical of such efforts, the originator of the breed is not fully known or acknowledged. See all of our expert product reviews . In any event, a beagle shepherd can resemble a sort of paper doll-style creature that has a very definite German shepherd body and a very obvious beagle head and floppy ears placed on top of it. It is not unattractive by any means but it distinctly shows the evidence of the dog\u2019s crossbreeding. The history of the beagle may go back to 5th century Greece. These dogs hunted in search of foxes, rabbits , and other small prey. In the 1500s, beagles became well-known in England as they hunted in packs with English gentlemen in search of deer , rabbits, and foxes. This dog\u2019s persistence, excellent sense of smell, and loud howling bark made it a helpful companion for hunters. Originally bred, starting in 1899, by Max von Stephanitz to assist shepherds by using various herding breeds, the German Shepherd is an exceptionally intelligent working dog breed. They excel as guardians in positions of service and make for loving and loyal additions to the family. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . With the beagle as a hunting hound and the German shepherd as a guard and herd dog, the crossbreed tends to take some of the protective edge off the shepherd and replace it with the happy-go-lucky genetics of the beagle, yet the beagle\u2019s keen instinct to hunt via scent remains a very dominant trait. See all of our expert product reviews . Unlike many designer crossbreeds, the Beagle Shepherd has proven to be something of a wild card when it comes to size and weight. Consider that a male beagle might be 12-15 inches high and 20-30 pounds in weight. An adult German shepherd male can clock in at anywhere from 24-26 inches in height and 65-90 pounds in weight. Beagle shepherds thus have a very wide range of body sizes to choose from. The normal expectation is that they will come in at anywhere from 16-24 inches tall and 22-56 pounds in weight. Females run slightly smaller with about 15-22 inches in height and 22-49 pounds in weight. Even that \u201caverage\u201d covers a very broad range and it is possible to find beagle shepherds at the low end of the beagle range or the high end of the German shepherd range. The overall size is much less dependable with the beagle shepherd than is seen in other designer dogs. While one of the main benefits of a designer crossbreed over a long-established purebred is that it has greater genetic diversity to fight off inherited health problems, the beagle shepherd has some definite health concerns. Like most other dogs, these are often geriatric in nature. Like many of the other short, long dogs, this hybrid can be prone to IVDD, or Intervertebral Disc Disease, which is a premature decay of the spine. This degenerative condition can improve to some degree with surgery but is progressive. Things such as obesity from overfeeding and under-exercising are not breed-specific, nor are the possibilities of cataracts later in life. The same goes for that most canine of diseases known as hip dysplasia or degeneration of the hip bones. Epilepsy is a factor in both breeds but this can generally respond to medication. On the German shepherd side of the family, the main risks come from various forms of intestinal tract issues that are more common in these dogs than overall. These can include such things as pancreatic troubles, bloat, and anal functioning problems. This dog combines many admirable traits which can produce a very desirable mix of characteristics. The German shepherd\u2019s loyalty and alertness to danger combine with the beagle\u2019s temperament of playfulness and high energy. It also carries some downside risks in the wrong environment. Beagles like to talk and were bred to hunt smaller creatures. This can lead to issues with barking and also represents a danger to other neighborhood or household pets that may not have proper socialization with their new family member. They like to chew on things, so it is very important to make sure that they always have something proper to chew on or else they will select something else. Apart from what one would do for any dog, there are some things that require particular emphasis when caring for this breed. Due to their eagle ears, they need regular examination and care to guard against ear infections. Their high-energy personality manifests itself in two ways. First off, they require a high degree of exercise. This means plenty of rough-housing as well as regular and strenuous walks that should include at least some amount of actual running. Secondly, they require near-constant companionship. You cannot leave one of these dogs alone for any appreciable length of time without risking trouble in the form of separation anxiety of one sort or another. They may howl, they may chew, and they may run around and break things. If you cannot be with your dog, you must have other dogs to keep it in line while you are away. This breed burns a lot of calories. As a result, it should be fed high-quality dog food in quantities of about 1 \u00bd cups per meal twice a day. So long as they exercise, occasional treats or table scraps can work. At regular appointments, discuss the ideal diet with the vet to address any health concerns. Try to seek out food with specific ingredients and nutrients that cater to this breed\u2019s range of potential conditions. The A-Z Animals recommendation of the best dog food for Beagle Spaniels is Eukanuba Adult Large Breed Dog Food. This blend with balanced fiber and prebiotics is easier on your dog\u2019s digestion. The high protein from lamb fortifies the muscles and the glucosamine promotes solid joints. With well-rounded nutrition like this, your Beagle Shepherd will stay in good shape for a great shot at long-term wellness from head to toe. Check Chewy or Amazon for this product. Beagle coat genetics seem to predominate. This means that the breed is relatively low maintenance so far as grooming is concerned. The dog will shed, particularly in the spring when it sloughs off its winter coat. A regular program of brushing about 2 or 3 times a week is sufficient to keep things untangled and the blood circulating properly. One of the best things about a Beagle Shepherd is that it is an easy dog to train in most ordinary things, Yet it is also very intelligent and playful, so it is also possible to instruct it in more elaborate tricks with relative ease. The one thing to avoid when training one of these dogs is punishment. They have long memories and have held grudges for some time from mistreatment. Patient repetition and a judicious award of treats will bring large rewards in terms of a very entertaining animal. Beagle Shepherds not only need a lot of exercise but they also need variation in their exercises. If trapped in a continuous rut, they will soon become bored and unresponsive. It is thus necessary to include more than just a casual walk as their daily regime. Running, walking, jumping, playing, should be part of their normal schedule. A short walk or run is not enough. They require a good mile-and-a-half or two miles of exercise daily in order to keep them in peak condition. Beagle Shepherd puppies need three things. Owners must carefully instruct them on what is proper to chew on and what is not proper to chew. It is also best to work with them on when and how much they should bark under various circumstances. The Beagle is meant to hunt and to constantly announce its presence. This instinct can get out of hand in an urban or suburban setting. They must also be very carefully introduced to other house pets so that they recognize them as part of the family from an early age. Otherwise, their hunting instinct may kick in at unwelcome times and focus upon unwanted targets. This is a very good dog for children due to their indefatigable energy and playfulness. It can, however, grow to a larger size than expected. This can lead to unintentional injuries resulting from a mix of big, happy dogs and small, happy children trying to occupy the same space and time. For the boys : For the girls:",

        "Text": "The German shepherd, or Alsatian, as British dog lovers call them, is the second most popular dog breed in the United States. This working dog from the herding group features a luxurious double coat that can be anywhere from medium to long and comes in a variety of colors such as traditional black and tan, solid white, or solid black. Their exceptional intelligence and adaptability make them well-suited for a wide array of jobs, including police work, service training, and, of course, loving companion. See all of our expert product reviews . This breed gets a bad reputation for aggressive behavior, but in reality, these dogs are more aloof with strangers than aggressive. As with any other breed, reputable breeders and early and consistent training determine the dog\u2019s personality. These dogs can alter their personalities to fit their owner and training, so it\u2019s up to the owner to show them how they should behave. There are quite a few German Shepherd crossbreeds, including: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . On average, German shepherds weigh between 75 and 90 pounds and stand 22 to 26 inches high at the shoulder. The males of this breed tend to be larger than the females. Like many purebred dogs, German shepherds are prone to some fairly serious health conditions. One such condition, degenerative myelopathy, is a neurological disease that targets the spinal cord. It tends to come on later in life and leads to reduced mobility. See all of our expert product reviews . Bloating is another life-threatening concern for this breed, so owners should establish proper eating routines from an early age. Owners can reduce the occurrence of bloating by feeding smaller meals throughout the day, using a dish that forces a dog to eat slowly, using an elevated feeder, and preventing heavy exercise for up to two hours after each meal. This breed can also develop other serious conditions such as: This breed has a certain level of dignity that many other breeds don\u2019t possess, which means you\u2019ll have to work for their friendship. Though it may take them longer to bond and make new friends than other dogs, once that friendship is forged, they make extremely loyal companions. These dogs are one of the most intelligent dog breeds, which makes them excel at any job their owner chooses. They are also quite sensitive and hate being left alone, so if you spend much of your time away from home and can\u2019t take your dog with you, a German shepherd is not the right dog for you. Another myth is that German shepherds aren\u2019t good with kids. On the contrary, their high energy, extreme trainability, and loyalty are all excellent traits for family pets. Due to their adult size and strength, early training and socialization around children are imperative to prevent injuries. It is also vital that parents teach their children how to interact with dogs safely. Contrary to popular belief, these dogs are not naturally aggressive dogs. One of the biggest myths about this breed is that even if they begin life as docile animals, they will develop aggression. Many times, the public bases its opinion of this breed on dogs that work in jobs that require selective aggressive tendencies, like the kind that is common in police dogs. Training is the most important factor in determining aggression in any dog. Since German shepherds are so adaptable and eager to please, owners can teach them calm behavior just as easily as aggressive behavior. That\u2019s not to say a well-trained German shepherd will never become aggressive; any dog who feels threatened may display aggressive behaviors to defend itself. Along these lines, German shepherds also have a bad and unfairly earned reputation for biting. This reputation is another behavior that some owners train in their dogs, leaving all German shepherds with a bad rap. In reality, labrador retrievers account for more bites on a yearly basis than German shepherds do. For most dogs, biting occurs when they are afraid, so proper training and socialization are imperative to keep your dog from displaying behaviors that could be deemed aggressive. The origins of the German Shepherd date back to just before the turn of the 20th century. They, of course, came from Germany but did not look like they do today until after World War II, after many years of breed solidification. These early shepherds were developed by a cavalry officer named Max von Stephanitz after he retired from the military. He worked with country sheep dogs to produce an extreme working dog that would be able to herd all day and run for long stretches of the day. The first versions had short tails and rough fur coats. As mentioned, in the United Kingdom, German shepherds are sometimes referred to as \u201cAlsatians\u201d, which draws some confusion. Many of this breed were often found in the Alsace area of France, which was once a region of Germany. Moreover, due to the two world wars, avoiding using \u201cGerman\u201d in the name may have been a marketing choice to help make the breed more popular. If you want the best dog food for your german shepherd first you need to consider whether your dog is still a puppy, an adult, or a senior dog. Smaller breeds mature to adulthood in about 10 months, a little under a year. While larger breeds, like German Shepherds, typically mature at 16 months, or about a year and a half. Most breeds are considered a senior at 10 years, though some very large breeds (100lb+) hit that milestone a little earlier around year 8. Based on the size, coat length, and specific health considerations for german shepherds our team recommends the following: German shepherds do well on high-quality food formulated especially for large breeds. These dogs tend to have somewhat sensitive stomachs, so they should only eat human food sparingly, if at all. If you do choose to feed your dog table scraps, you should avoid fatty foods and never feed them cooked bones. When dogs eat cooked bones, the bones break into splintery shards that can perforate their stomach or bowels on their way through the digestive system. There are many health problems that can plague German Shepherds, so owners have to try their best to find a dog food that has the correct nutritional profile to keep them up and moving. At A-Z Animals, we\u2019ve taken a look at Royal Canin Breed Health Nutrition German Shepherd Loaf in Sauce Wet Dog Food, and we think it could be a good option for your German Shepherd.

Like any other purebred dog, you\u2019ll need to find pet insurance that covers the hereditary genetic disorders associated with a German shepherd. All German shepherds have a thick double coat consisting of a soft, dense undercoat and a coarse, water-resistant topcoat that is medium to long. Their coat is easy to maintain most of the year by brushing them every few days. Twice a year, they go through a major shedding spree called blowing, a month-long process in which they lose their seasonal undercoat. During the blowing season, you will need to brush your dog daily to avoid matting and hair build-up around the house. Aside from brushing, the maintenance routine for a German shepherd is straightforward. All you need to do is brush their teeth regularly and trim their nails monthly. This breed is fairly clean with only a slight odor, so they only need bathing a few times a year. Unlike many intelligent breeds, German shepherds are eager to please their owners, which makes them a joy to train. All herding dogs have a certain level of protectiveness toward their families, so proper training and socialization should start immediately to show them that not every stranger means them harm. German shepherds are an active breed and require copious amounts of exercise to keep them happy and healthy. Since these dogs are highly intelligent, their exercise choices need not end at walks or backyard play. Dogs and owners alike can enjoy intellectual and agility-based activities like tracking and herding to create an unbreakable bond between them. As with all puppies, weeks 7 to 12 are the most crucial when it comes to proper socialization for German shepherds. If you want your dog to get along well with children or other pets, this is the optimal window to have them accept other members of their new family without many questions. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t teach your dog to get along with kids and other animals down the road, but the more exposure you can give your pup to all types of situations when they are young, the more likely you will be to have a calm, well-adjusted adult dog. German shepherds don\u2019t become adults until they are about 3 years old, so remember to be patient with your dog even when he looks like he\u2019s outgrown his puppyhood. If you raise your German shepherd with children from the start, they get along famously with all members of the family. That said, they are high-energy dogs who don\u2019t always realize how big they are. Owners should take time to teach both dog and child how to safely interact with one another and never leave them unsupervised to avoid accidental injuries. It is in the nature of a German shepherd to be aloof towards strangers, however, and children are no exception. It is vital for any owner who plans to have their dog around unfamiliar children to socialize them extensively and train them for this task at a young age. At the same time, parents should take care to teach their children the proper way to approach any unknown dog. A few breeds that are similar in size or personality to German shepherds are Australian shepherds , Collies and Old English sheepdogs . Though there have been quite a number of famous German shepherds throughout history, the one who brought his breed into the spotlight was Rin-Tin-Tin . Corporal Lee Duncan found Rin-Tin-Tin and his littermates during World War 1 in the small French village of Flirey. Duncan raised the pup as his own and taught him an expansive collection of tricks. Rin-Tin-Tin\u2019s impressive intelligence ultimately landed him a number of movie deals. Over the course of his illustrious career, he often played the part of a wolf because movie directors found him much easier to work with than an actual wolf. This famous pup was the original key to the success of the Warner Brothers film company. A few popular names for these dogs are:",

Originating from around 1000 BCE, the Samoyed breed has remained remarkably consistent in both appearance and temperament. The breed is called Samoyed in honor of the Samoyede people, who were a nomadic group that lived in the icy tundras of northern Russia and Siberia, situated close to the Arctic Circle. The Samoyed breed was created from a type of dog called the Nenets Herding Laika. This spitz breed was frequently used for reindeer herding in northern Siberia. During that time, the Nenets people who used the dog were sometimes referred to as Samoyeds, which eventually led to the breed being named after them.

Knowing these facts can help you provide the best possible care for your dog. Glaucoma is one health concern for some Samoyeds. Glaucoma occurs when there is increased pressure in one of the dog\u2019s eyes. Sometimes, glaucoma may be hereditary, other times it can be caused by other eye problems that lead to less fluid in the eye. Hip dysplasia is a common problem with many dogs, and Samoyeds are not exempt from it. This is a genetic condition where the dog\u2019s thighbone doesn\u2019t fit correctly into its hip joint. This causes the two bones to rub against one another. Over time, this will become painful for the dog and can cause them to limp. Samoyed Hereditary Glomerulopathy is another hereditary condition. Males are more likely to develop more severe forms of this condition and may begin exhibiting symptoms around the time they are 3 months old. In severe cases, the dog will die by the time they are 15 months old. This is a hereditary condition, but a genetic screen test hasn\u2019t been developed for it yet.

Samoyed puppy owners should be informed about glomerulopathy and its effects on the kidneys.

Samoyeds will also need to be bathed about once every two months. Be prepared for this task to take a good amount of time. Thoroughly washing and drying their thick coats can be very time-consuming.

The Newfoundland started out earning its keep working with fishermen, in Newfoundland. Along with its fishing boat duties, this cousin of the Labrador retriever and the Irish water spaniel also earned renown for its courage and its steadfastness in rescuing its human friends. The St Bernard on the other hand worked as a rescue operative for the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the heights of the Pennine Alps. It was the breeder Heinrich Essig, of Leonberg, Germany who was inspired to create a breed which would be a worthy companion of royalty, in the 1800s. His efforts yielded fruit when royalty from all over Europe came seeking his brand new regal breed. Included in that list were the Prince of Wales, the Empress of Austria, and Umberto I, King of Italy. But not every Leonberger got to live a pampered lifestyle being fed the choicest cuts of meat. Others had to earn their keep as watchdogs or putting their impressive size and strength to use tugging carts. See all of our expert product reviews . During World Wars I and II Leonbergers were employed pulling ammunition carts during both armed conflicts. As a result, they nearly became extinct on both occasions. Following the Second World War only eight Leonbergers remained. Thanks to assiduous breeding efforts by Otto Josenhans and Karl Stadelmann, the breed was saved from the brink of extinction and was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010.

When fully grown, a male has a weight of as much as 180 pounds, and a female 140 pounds. When they reach eight weeks old, these puppies have an average weight of 22 pounds. They are considered adult-size at 18-22 months. This pet has health issues commonly seen in other large breeds of dogs. One example is called bloat. This happens as a result of a dog taking in too much air, food, or water. Signs of bloat are a distended abdomen, drooling, whining, and retching. It is serious and the dog should be taken to a vet for care immediately. Some owners use a special bowl that distributes small amounts of food, so their dog isn\u2019t able to gulp down food too quickly. Hip dysplasia also affects some dogs of this large breed. It is essentially a hip joint that is out of alignment. It can cause lameness and pain for a dog. A vet may recommend weight loss, medication, or surgery if it\u2019s an extreme case. Elbow dysplasia is the misalignment of the elbow joint. It can cause pain and lameness as well. Physical therapy, medication, and surgery are all treatments a vet may recommend.

Taking thorough care of this pet means considering its diet, grooming, and exercise needs. A Leonberger puppy and an adult dog have their requirements to keep them feeling good. Check out the facts on the care of this pooch. Leonberger puppies have nutritional needs that are different from fully grown dogs. Feeding this breed the right nutrients can be the key to maintaining its health. Leonberger puppy food: Protein such as lean chicken, turkey and brown rice in this puppy\u2019s diet lends nourishment to its growing muscles, joints, and tissue. Vitamin E and Omega 6 fatty acids both support its coat and skin health. This puppy burns carbohydrates in its food to give it energy for its daily antics. It\u2019s best to feed puppies three or four small meals spread through the day. This keeps their energy up so they can explore as puppies do! Leonberger adult dog food: This active dog needs lean protein like chicken, lamb, and turkey to continue to enjoy healthy muscles and joints throughout its lifespan. Remember, hip dysplasia is a concern for this breed so protein is essential in its bowl. While there is less fat than protein in quality dog food , fat is necessary to give an adult dog energy for the day\u2019s activities. Vitamin C helps the dog\u2019s immune system to head off disease and illness. Glucosamine is important for maintaining healthy joints. Bloat is another health issue for this dog. It\u2019s a good idea to space out meals and exercise and divide one portion of food in half and feed the dog one half at a time. That helps the dog to avoid taking too much air into its stomach by eating a large amount of food too fast.

Not only do they shed a large amount of hair regularly, but their shedding activity also increases with the change of seasons. Proper grooming care must include daily brushing. It\u2019s recommended an owner use a tool called an undercoat rake to remove tangles from the hair located closest to the dog\u2019s skin. A slicker brush is the best tool for working through the upper or outer coat to remove debris, mats, and tangles. Professional breeders will tell you that grooming care takes at least 30 minutes because of the thickness of the dog\u2019s coat. Be sure to pay special attention to the hair behind the dog\u2019s ears and on the backs of its legs. These are two locations that tend to attract tangles. Another essential task to take care of during the grooming routine is to trim the dog\u2019s nails. This is done every two weeks. Because they are smart and eager to please, training this dog is a fairly easy task. An effective program of obedience training is necessary for a dog of this size. One of the basic facts about the care of this breed is it needs 60 minutes of exercise daily. They mix well with other dogs so a dog park is a good thought. If the dog is fully trained, taking it to the woods for an off-leash run would be fun. Taking the dog to a lake or a pond would be a real treat. These dogs are dedicated swimmers! This is not a good breed of dog to own if you live in an apartment . Socialization is essential for any dog, but it\u2019s especially important for a breed of this size. Socialization as a puppy teaches a Leonberger not to jump up on people, bark excessively, etc. This process requires taking these puppies to different environments and allowing them to interact with people of different ages. The especially large size of this canine means it should be monitored while spending time with children. Despite having a friendly temperament and being fond of kids, the size of this dog puts very small children at risk of being bumped into or knocked down. A socialized Leonberger is more aware of how to behave around kids and adults. The Great Pyrenees (Pyrenean Mountain Dog), longhaired Saint Bernard, and Newfoundland are all similar breeds to the Leonberger. Popular names for this large breed:",

If you plan on doing this trimming on your own you can purchase a pair of clippers, a stripping tool, and shears.

These dogs date back to the 1880s in England. A British dog owner named Frank Jones bred these terriers to drive rats and foxes out of their holes. Their persistence and courage made this appealing (and easy) work for this dog. They were sometimes used in sporting contests to see which terrier could drive out all of the rats from a burrow in the shortest amount of time. This breed actually was a folded-ear version of the Norwich Terrier until there was a call to have them developed and recognized as their own breed. After several years of argument, the Norfolk terrier was recognized by The Kennel Club in 1964 as a separate breed apart from the Norwich terrier . The different names come from the British county and town where they were bred. While the Norfolk terrier has ears that fold down, the Norwich terrier\u2019s ears stand up.

As with any canine, Norfolk terriers have some health issues that are common to their breed. For example, hip dysplasia is a common health issue for Norfolk terriers. Hip dysplasia is a genetic condition where the dog\u2019s hip joint is not fitting in the way it should. It can cause lameness and pain. A second common health issue is heart disease. This condition affects older Norfolk terriers and usually comes in the form of a weakened heart valve. Obesity can increase the odds that this dog develops heart disease. A liver disorder called a portosystemic shunt is another health issue for these dogs. Essentially, this condition deprives a dog\u2019s liver of proper blood flow. When there\u2019s not enough blood flowing through the liver, this organ can\u2019t take toxins out of the bloodstream. The most common health issues of Norfolk terriers are: Feisty is one of the best words to describe the personality of a Norfolk or Norwich terrier. Despite their small size, these dogs are fearless. That\u2019s part of the reason why they are successful at digging up the holes of rats and other rodents to scare them out of the area. They are quick to bark at strangers on their owner\u2019s property. One of the most notable traits of a Norfolk terrier is its loyalty. Instead of sleeping in a dog bed or crate , this dog is much happier sleeping on the bed of its owner. In short, Norfolk terriers love to be with their owners, tagging along both inside and outside the house. Some owners think of their Norfolk terrier as a pint-sized guardian! Their behavior is high energy. These dogs like to run, dig, jump and play. They can be rough and tumble at playtime and are tougher than they look. Norfolk terriers are good with children especially when they join a household as a puppy. Having a Norfolk terrier as a pet means giving it the right kind of care so it will lead a long, healthy life. For instance, feeding this breed the right type of food can prevent some of the common health issues mentioned above. Consider these important factors related to its care. It\u2019s important to note this breed\u2019s propensity for heart disease. Consult your vet about your Norfolk Terrier\u2019s health and diet, and do a little research on the connection between legumes in dog food and heart failure in dogs. There is a variety of legume-free dog foods on the market. Not surprisingly, a Norfolk terrier puppy needs a different type of diet than an adult dog. Look at some of the main ingredients: Norfolk terrier puppy food: Protein should be the main ingredient in food for a Norfolk terrier puppy. This gives them energy they can burn with all of their activities. Calcium is important for strong bone and teeth development. Strong bone development helps to prevent hip dysplasia. Antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids contribute to a puppy\u2019s strong immune system and healthy organs including its liver. Norfolk terrier adult dog food: Protein is also an important ingredient for adult Norfolk terriers. The right amount of protein and fat gives them the energy they need without adding extra weight. Vitamin A is essential to a dog\u2019s eye health and antioxidants boost the immune system. Keeping calcium in the dog\u2019s diet contributes to continued bone health and may help prevent hip dysplasia. Avoid fillers and go with whole grains and vegetables in an adult dog\u2019s food to maintain its energy and metabolism. With all this in mind, A-Z Animals selects Wellness CORE Small Breed Dry Dog Food with Wholesome Grains, High Protein Dog Food as the best dog food for Norfolk Terriers.

How much does a Norfolk terrier shed? Norfolk terriers shed very little. In fact, they\u2019re classified as hypoallergenic dogs because they\u2019re light shedders and leave behind a small amount of dander. These dogs have a double coat that needs to be groomed twice a year by a professional. A groom trims and hand strips the coat removing dead and loose hair. This process also gets rid of tangles and mats. An owner should brush their terrier\u2019s coat once a week using a soft brush with boar\u2019s hair bristles or a slicker brush. This removes dirt and minor tangles. It\u2019s best to give this dog a bath just once a month. Ichthyosis, which is itchy, dried out skin is a common ailment of this breed. Bathing this dog more than once a month can bring on this condition. A Norfolk terrier can be challenging to train. This is due to its stubborn streak. It can be easily distracted by birds or rodents in the training area. A Havanese is about the same size as the British-born Norfolk terrier but is easier to train. This is another smart dog but isn\u2019t as easily distracted as a Norfolk terrier. Using treats and praise can help a Norfolk terrier learn its lessons more quickly. Once a Norfolk terrier works through obedience training, it is a perfect candidate to train for a sporting event. Earthdog is a non-competitive event in which Norfolk terriers and other small dogs test their digging skills to find rodents. These high-energy dogs need regular exercise to stay healthy. Unless they are trained to stay with an owner, they should remain on a leash when walked. Otherwise, they are likely to take off after squirrels, cats, and other animals during a neighborhood walk. They need 20 to 40 minutes of exercise per day. Playing hide and seek and chase are great activities for a family to play with their Norfolk terrier. This dog is suitable for apartment life and can be a good guardian. But it needs space to exercise. An apartment dweller should be willing to take their Norfolk terrier on walks.

        "Text": "Border terriers can truly be described as \u201ceverything in moderation\u201d when it comes to their dimensions, temperament and behavior. The breed is strong and sturdy despite its smaller size, which makes it a perfect fit for the rough countryside it was bred to traverse. These dogs originated from fringe areas of England and Scotland along the border between the two countries, where they were meant to aid hunters and larger hounds in their pursuit of foxes , vermin and local game. Unlike other dogs in the terrier group, everything about this breed is geared towards practicality and work rather than appearance. Border terriers tend to get along peacefully with other dogs as well as people, which makes them a solid choice for many households. See all of our expert product reviews . The border terrier is a staunch and sturdy companion animal that makes up for its somewhat awkward, otter-like appearance with an endearing personality and friendly demeanor. Owners will find that these dogs are receptive to training, mix well with other dogs, and don\u2019t require all that much grooming or maintenance. Farmers and shepherds living in the hilly region of the Scottish-English border bred terriers that were both fast and agile in order to hunt the fox, which was a very cunning animal and had been stealing sheep from the area. The terriers needed to have long enough legs to keep up with the foxhounds and the riders on horseback but also had to be small enough to fit into the fox\u2019s den and make it come out. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The Border Terrier is descended from a type of dog that was full of energy and could endure a lot, thanks to its protective coat that kept it safe from the wet and difficult environment of the border. A breed historian said of the Border\u2019s working abilities that they are able to climb any wall and get through any wire entanglement. Furthermore, if the fox goes underground, the dog will flush it out or stay there until the situation is resolved. The Border Terrier has its roots in the north of England, where it was formerly known by other names, such as Reedwater Terrier, Ullswater Terrier, and Coquetdale Terrier. It earned its lasting fame in Northumberland, where it was used for foxhunting alongside hounds and was known for getting along well with other dogs. This form of foxhunting was drastically different from the traditional British foxhunting found on large estates, with riders in red coats riding huge packs of hounds solely for sport. See all of our expert product reviews . The Border Terrier breed has its roots in the foxhunts of the Borderland region, which were used to protect shepherds\u2019 flocks from predators. This breed is still popular in the United Kingdom today as a vibrant and low-maintenance companion for everyday people. The Kennel Club of England officially recognized the Border Terrier in 1920, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) did the same 10 years later. These terriers have a sturdy medium build with relatively narrow shoulders and bodies. Grown adults weigh between 11 and 16 pounds. The height at the withers should be a little longer than the distance to the tail. The measured height for adults should be 11 to 14 inches for females and 13 to 16 for males. These terriers are usually healthy animals, and most substantial health issues can be screened out through responsible breeding. Hip problems are among the chief complaints of the border terrier, including general hip dysplasia and Perthes disease. Significant or total loss of eyesight through progressive retinal atrophy is another breed-related health risk, and juvenile cataracts are also possible. These dogs can have an elevated risk of seizures and have a chance of developing a rare disease called canine epileptoid cramping syndrome (CECS), which is relatively new and unique to the breed. Border terriers have plenty of desirable personality traits for all kinds of prospective owners and families. They were reared specifically to accompany and aid other dogs in the hunt, so they are generally quite peaceful with their canine brethren compared to most breeds in the terrier group. They are alert and energetic but not particularly territorial or aggressive towards people. Their outgoing, playful, and affectionate behavior, combined with their smaller stature, makes them a great fit for families with small children. They are also considered a great breed for city living . Even though these dogs are considered low maintenance compared to many other breeds, there are still a lot of things owners need to consider before choosing one. As working dogs, border terriers need and deserve an environment that maximizes their unique mix of personality traits and characteristics. Good quality puppy food with balanced ingredients is usually fine for border terrier puppies. Puppies should be switched over to an adult blend or veterinarian-supervised homemade diet as they age. Owners should be careful to avoid overfeeding and minimize fat content to avoid excessive weight gain, which can aggravate the breed\u2019s common hip problems. A-Z Animals believes the best dog food for Border Terriers is Wellness CORE Small Breed Dry Dog Food with Wholesome Grains, High Protein Dog Food.

In combination with high protein, healthy grains like barley, oats, and quinoa provide fiber to help your dog feel full, so it won\u2019t eat too much. Finally, taurine is a plus for both heart and eye health. Check Chewy and Amazon for this product. Border terrier owners don\u2019t need to worry much about maintenance and grooming. In fact, excessive washing and trimming can reduce their coat\u2019s natural dirt-repellent properties. Wiping off dirt and mud with a moist towel is usually sufficient, along with weekly brushing sessions to catch loose hairs. These terriers are bred to serve alongside man and animal, so they are usually very receptive to training. They do have an independent nature, but they are still generally obedient and reliable with some work. Obedience and self-control are important aspects for independent-minded border terriers to make your life easier on walks and protect them from impulsive activities that could put them in danger. Their origins as working dogs to aid hunters in rough terrain mean they really do need and benefit from regular exercise. Owners should expect at least 30 minutes of vigorous exercise each day, preferably combined with activities that go beyond simply running. Chasing, catching, and traversing rough terrain are all skills bred into the border terrier, and they enjoy exercising these natural talents. Border terrier puppies don\u2019t have any notable issues or care requirements aside from a need for supervision. They like to explore and investigate, which can create difficulties when mixed with natural athletic ability and high energy levels. Pens and baby gates are necessary for keeping them under control when they are old enough to start moving around. While border terriers aren\u2019t the best choice for cat owners, they do make excellent companions for children. They are observant and friendly and rarely adopt an aggressive attitude toward people. They are also relatively small, so they are unlikely to cause accidental injury to young kids. Owners should train their dogs to stick to their own toys as they are prone to chewing and may start destroying a child\u2019s favorite stuffed animal if they don\u2019t know better. Their rising popularity and general approval by canine and lifestyle publications have propelled the breed toward stardom. Several notable celebrities own a border terrier, and they have also been featured in several major films, including Anchorman .",

While you can buy or adopt these dogs from a nearby rescue shelter, you would have to ask your breeders to confirm the health history of your new friend. See all of our expert product reviews . Before you buy a Beaglier from a rescue shelter, it is important to know the pros and cons. Here is a list of pros and cons for these dogs: The compact size of the Beaglier gives them a height of approximately 12 to 16 inches. However, their weight can range significantly from 12 to 33 pounds on average at their full grown size. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .

However, since they are a crossbreed of the Beagle and King Cavalier Spaniel , they inherit some health issues from their parents. Therefore, it is important to know what health issues are worth watching out for from the breeders if you are able to communicate with them. Hip dysplasia is a common concern. It is rather easy to spot with an x-ray, but the pup may first start to limp as a sign that they are in pain. Beagle dwarfism may also occur, along with hypothyroidism. Ear infections and eye issues are of particular concern with this breed. See all of our expert product reviews . Some problems that these dogs suffer from include: Beagliers are small and docile, which makes them the perfect pets for first-time owners. The temperament of the Beaglier makes them a good match for families with children, regardless of how old they are. They are relatively active and friendly with other dogs. However, they might not do so well with other pets such as cats or small rodents. These dogs are rather loving, preferring a place by your side in silence when you need emotional support. They have an incredible sense of smell, leading them to explore and go on their own adventures. They will need a strong and sturdy fence to ensure that they do not escape when left alone. With any animal, it is important to know what they will need to be happy and healthy in your home. Here are a few tips on taking care of your new Beaglier. The breed unfortunately has a bit of a laundry list of potential health issues. It\u2019s vital to take your Beaglier to the bet regularly to screen for any conditions and discuss the best diet for your individual pet. The genetic parents of this breed have vastly different dietary requirements, making it difficult to determine the best food for the Beaglier. When in doubt, high-quality dry dog food is the best choice, though their size and age will determine how much they need. While some dogs need as little as \u00be cup of food per meal, larger animals could need up to 1.5 cups instead. Base the number of meals each day on their current size. Looking at the breed\u2019s health profile, A-Z Animals says the best dog food for Beagliers is Farmina Natural & Delicious Ocean Ancestral Grain Cod & Orange Adult Medium & Maxi Dog Food. We recommend this for Beagliers because of how nutritious the ocean ingredients are for the immune system and full-body wellness. The fish is a natural source of omegas and amino acids. The glucosamine and chondroitin help guard against joint issues like bad knees and hips, taurine is great for the heart and eyes, plus beta-carotene for additional eye and vision support. Find Farmina N&D Ocean Ancestral Grain Cod and Orange dog food on Chewy or Amazon. These dogs are generally very easy to groom as they have short and shiny coats, which they usually inherit from their parents. Brushing them removes the excess and dead hair off their bodies, though shedding is not much of a problem with these dogs. They do not need to be bathed often as this would lead their skin to become dry and flaky. They may need protection from the sun to prevent them from experiencing an allergic or adverse reaction to the sun. Brush their teeth and trim their nails regularly. Make sure to keep their ears clean to avoid infections and earwax buildup. Training the Beaglier is rather unpredictable because the two breeds that make it up have contradictory attitudes towards their learning. While one picks up their commands rather quickly with their desire to please their owner, the other prefers to take a more relaxed approach. Regardless of the genetics that the Beaglier sides with, keep a positive attitude to encourage the same type of response. Do not use any negative reinforcement with these dogs as that could have an adverse effect on their behavior. Consistency is the key with them. These dogs do not have extensive exercise needs. One or two walks around the neighborhood would give them the physical activity necessary to keep healthy and in shape. Still, Beagliers greatly enjoy indoor playtime as well, which is why they make such great companions for children. Take care of the Beaglier puppies just as you would take care of the adults. However, it is best to introduce the puppies into a social circle early on in life. This would help them avoid behavioral issues and would also help them develop good habits early on in life. Divide the meals of the puppies into smaller portions while giving them a higher quantity of meals to satisfy their small stomachs. Beagliers are great around children and other members of the family, adding entertaining playtime to the group. However, due to their compact size, they are very prone to get injured while playing. It is not recommended that these dogs are left unsupervised around small children who can unintentionally hurt them while playing. This breed is suitable for children who are old enough to understand the dog\u2019s nature and can safely play with it.

        "Name": "Daniff",
        "Genus": "Canis",
        "Diet": "Omnivore with no preference",
        "Text": "\u201cThe ancestors of this breed were used as war dogs by the Mongolian leader Kublai Khan. \u201d The Daniff is a recent American mixture of two large breed dogs, the great Dane and the mastiff, breeds with ancient origins in Tibet and the Middle East. The original breeds were developed for hunting large game but over the years have become more popular as companion animals. Despite their imposing size, Daniffs are not aggressive and make gentle, playful, and loyal family pets. They get along very well with children and other animals. At the same time, they are protective and make great watchdogs, intimidating potential intruders as much by their size as their bark. On the downside, they are expensive to maintain, but many families will find the investment well worth it. Dog owners of any breed are recommended to provide their pet with a high-quality dog food made with natural ingredients and as few artificial additives and low-nutritional fillers as possible. Spending more on better quality food is an important part of preventative healthcare that can save you expensive vet bills in the future. It is also best to provide foods specially formulated for the developmental stage of your dog: puppy, adult, or senior. Follow the recommended portions closely and do not feed your dog table scraps, as they can have a tendency toward obesity if overfed or given calorie-rich people food. At A-Z Animals we recommend Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula . Real meat is the first ingredient, supplemented with whole grains, vegetables, and fruit. It\u2019s designed by animal nutritionists and holistic veterinarians to include an exact blend of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals to help your dog maintain a healthy immune system. It comes in formulations for dogs of different ages and in several different flavors, such as chicken and brown rice or lamb and oatmeal. It has the benefits of a more expensive brand while still being affordable, which is an important consideration when feeding a constantly hungry large breed. Daniffs are considered a giant-breed dog with an average height of 27-33 inches and weight of 115-190 pounds. Their large size can predispose them to problems with their bones and joints. Daniffs can inherit the health issues that are most common to their parent breeds: great Danes and mastiffs. Hybrid breeds do tend to be hardy, but it is unpredictable how healthy an individual puppy will turn out to be. Some of the issues most frequently reported are bloat, hip and elbow dysplasia, heart issues, cancer, eye problems, skeletal issues, and hypertrophic osteodystrophy. It\u2019s important to keep your dog on a good diet throughout its developmental stages and have regular veterinary checkups to catch any issues early on. In summary, these are the issues you may be most likely to encounter with Daniffs: To people unfamiliar with the breed, a Daniff can be highly intimidating with its large size and deep voice. It is protective of its family but will only show aggression when it feels threatened. If you\u2019re friendly, you might actually find it more likely you\u2019ll get knocked down and kissed all over the face than bitten. Puppies will bond strongly with their humans, including children, who they adore. They also adjust well to other pets, including dogs and cats. Some training is required to help them learn good manners and not overwhelm others with the size and enthusiasm of their love. Daniffs can have a stubborn streak, but they are also quite eager to please. Love, positive reinforcement, and consistency are the keys to effective training. Daniffs have short soft fur that is relatively low maintenance. They come in six colors: fawn with a black mask, brindle, blue, black, harlequin (white with irregular patches all over), and mantle (black and white with solid black on their backs, like a blanket.) This breed has a very low-shedding coat, but the size of the animal means that even this low level of shed will leave a lot of hair and dander around your house. In normal times, they should be brushed once a week, but during the shedding season, two or more times may be required to control the hair. Some puppies inherit wrinkled skin from their mastiff ancestors. The wrinkles should be periodically cleaned by wiping with a damp washcloth, making sure to dry the area thoroughly to prevent bacterial growth between the folds. Nail clipping can be a real challenge in an adult dog that decides it doesn\u2019t like it. Because they can be difficult to control physically once they get large, it\u2019s important early in puppyhood to get them accustomed to having their paws held and their nails clipped. This can be an early, regular practice even if it is just \u201cpretend\u201d to help them be more comfortable with the experience. Daniffs are very intelligent, loving, and eager to please. Most of the time they are quite submissive. However, at times they can be stubborn. It\u2019s important to start obedience training with them as early as possible, as a poorly trained adult can be quite unmanageable as a pet. If you feel ill-equipped to train your puppy yourself, invest in professional training. One way or another, training is an absolute must with this breed. One advantage of a training program with other dogs is that it will help them socialize with other pups and humans. Their protective instincts are one of their strengths, but they have to learn the difference between friends and potential threats, remembering that you are in charge and taking their cues from you. Daniff puppies are energetic and require a moderate amount of exercise. Two long walks a day are recommended, along with play time in a fenced yard. They enjoy playing chase, tag, and catch with their humans as well. They\u2019re very social and will act out with behaviors such as chewing and barking if left alone too long. Despite their size, they are still really indoor dogs at heart and will want to sleep with you in the house at night rather than a kennel. At the same time, these are not great pets for cramped apartment living. The ideal environment for them is a large home with a fenced backyard where a family member will be home most of the time. Daniffs are loving and affectionate toward children and other animals, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, etc. They have a low prey instinct and will tolerate smaller beings very well without deliberately hurting them. However, they do have herding instincts and can become over-excited and rambunctious. They can also be quite clumsy. It\u2019s easy for them to forget their size and bowl over smaller children and animals. Parents should provide supervision until their children are old enough not to be hurt by the Daniff\u2019s enthusiastic nature.
