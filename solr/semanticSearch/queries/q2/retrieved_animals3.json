        "Text": "The Flowerhorn fish, also known as the Flowerhorn cichlid, is an artificial creation of human breeders, thought to originate from Southeast Asia in the 1990s. This unique freshwater hybrid was produced from crosses between several different types of cichlids, including blood parrots, red devils, and three spot cichlids (or the trimac). Today there are more than a dozen different varieties of the Flowerhorn, but the Zhen Zhu , Golden Monkey , and Kamfa are among the most popular, each one varying in its colors, markings, and shape. While purely human creation, some owners have discarded them back into the wild, where they can aggressively out-compete native fish (though many of the males are sterile). For this reason, it is considered to be an invasive species in many countries. See all of our expert product reviews . Because it was artificially created by humans, the Flowerhorn is not recognized as a distinct species and is given the name Amphilophus hybrid . It was bred from several other hybrid cichlids , a family of freshwater tropical fish distributed throughout the world. Cichlids are very popular with breeders and aquarium owners for their incredible diversity of bright, garish colors and complex body markings. Although this species is not recognized as a distinct species because it has been cross-bred by hobbyists numerous times with various species of Central American cichlid species, there are still four main varietals, in addition to the numerous others. None of these entire species is a native species found in the wild, even though they may currently be found there now, they are not endemic to these areas. These types are: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . While it is hard to verify, it is believed that these fish are derived from a cross of the Blood Parrot Cichlid and another hybrid called the Red Devil Cichlid. The Flowerhorn cichlid is a medium-sized fish, normally measuring anywhere up to 16 inches in size. It is characterized by a rounded, symmetrical appearance with a long dorsal fin running along the back, a fairly long anal fin, and a fan-shaped tail fin. These fish also have two sets of teeth: the normal set in the mouth and a secondary set in the throat (known as pharyngeal teeth) that help to grind up food. By far the most prominent characteristic, however, is the large protruding bump on the forehead (known as the nuchal hump), composed of a bulbous soft tissue of fat or gel. The purpose of this bump isn\u2019t fully understood, but it may have something to do with sex recognition in many cichlid species. Depending on the strain, this animal can come in many different colors; usually a white base with orange, red, or black markings running sideways along the body. Blue and green are common colors as well. Males are fairly easy to recognize. They tend to be larger than females with more vivid colors and a bigger forehead bump. Although bred in captivity, the Flowerhorn fish is a wild tropical species with very particular needs. It will probably require a large tank with plenty of space to swim around in; some experts claim it will need at least 70 gallons, but it might be necessary to go as large as 100 gallons for a single fish. The water should be consistently maintained at a temperature of 80 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit and a pH of 7.0 to 8.0. A standard canister filter with a moderate flow rate will keep the tank clean and healthy. The tank should be filled with a soft substrate and only a few minor decorations. The Flowerhorn has a tendency to dig around in the dirt and root up plants. A bit of driftwood and a few medium-sized rocks should be sufficient to properly simulate a \u201cnatural\u201d environment. The Flowerhorn appears to be a curious fish that likes to roam around and investigate its surroundings. There are even anecdotal reports that the Flowerhorn fish likes to interact with its owner and can recognize a person\u2019s face. However, depending on the breed, they can be a bit territorial and do not often tolerate the presence of another fish in the tank. Flowerhorns are usually quite happy on their own, and pairing them with another fish can result in one attacking the other. If you do plan on getting a tank mate, then you might want to try a medium-sized fish like a pleco, an Oscar fish , or a silver Arowana that also tolerates similar environmental conditions. Do not pair them with smaller fish that lack the ability to stand their ground against the Flowerhorn. In order to ensure that there\u2019s plenty of room for two fish, you will probably need a tank of around 150 gallons. The Flowerhorn fish does not exist naturally in the wild. It was gradually developed by breeders in Malaysia , Thailand , and Taiwan , each one crossing it with a new strain or species to produce entirely novel types. Since the 1990s, it has become very popular with aquarium hobbyists throughout East Asia . It also gained a small but eager following in Europe and the United States . However, because of irresponsible disposal, this fish sometimes appears in natural habitats around Southeast Asia, displacing native species. A few countries may actually ban their import. As a popular aquarium fish, the Flowerhorn faces no serious threats in captivity. However, the quality of their care will have a significant impact on their lifespan. A poorly cared for fish will be more likely to develop health conditions. One of the most common problems is called hole-in-the-head disease. This self-explanatory condition is often caused by poor water quality and the presence of carbon. Moreover, white spots around the gills and body could be a sign of a freshwater parasite called ich. Knowing the signs is the first step toward treating your fish. In captivity, the Flowerhorn obviously has no natural predators. But In the wild, it can be preyed upon by larger fish . The Flowerhorn fish can be described best as an opportunistic omnivore. It is not particularly picky about what kinds of foods it eats. In captivity, plant-based foods in any form (including pellets) should compose part of its diet. It particularly enjoys peas, lettuce, and spinach. This should be supplemented with a protein-rich diet consisting of worms, shrimp , crickets , grasshoppers , and other insects . Owners will need to feed them around two or three times a day. Flowerhorns are voracious eaters and will pretty much consume almost anything you feed them, so try to limit their caloric intake a little to prevent weight gain. The Flowerhorn fish has a reputation for being a little finicky to breed in captivity. Males can be aggressive during the courtship process and may sometimes attack the female. Even if they do mate with the female, some of them are completely infertile due to the hybridization process. If you plan to breed Flowerhorns, then reproduction should ideally occur in a separate tank from the main one. Some breeders like to place a divider between the pair with enough water flow to help hormones pass through. Females will lay up to a thousand eggs per month, whether or not a male is actually present. Once they\u2019ve properly mated, the male (and sometimes the female as well) will stand guard over the eggs until they\u2019re ready to hatch about one or two weeks later. Paternal investment usually ends when the baby fry starts to swim, usually a few days after hatch. By the time they\u2019ve consumed all the yolk from their eggs, owners will need to feed the baby fry up to 10 times per day for the first few months of their lives. At three or four months of age, the baby fry reaches a few inches large and is usually sold at that point. Some of the larger breeds of Flowerhorns can survive up to 12 years in captivity, providing the owner with plenty of enjoyment and entertainment. The number of Flowerhorn fish worldwide is unknown. Since this isn\u2019t a natural species, the IUCN Red List (or any other conservation organization) hasn\u2019t assigned it a conservation status.",

        "Text": "While the Madagascar tenrec closely resembles a hedgehog, they are not related to each other. Tenrecs are small, insectivorous mammals that are only native to Madagascar. They are closely related to hedgehogs and have a similar appearance, although they sometimes lack the spines that hedgehogs have. They are nocturnal animals and spend most of their time in trees or burrows. There are two main types: the common tenrec and the greater tenrec. The common tenrec is the largest tenrec species and can grow up to two pounds. The greater tenrec is smaller, only growing to weigh around seven ounces. Both species are covered in fur, which can be either brown or black in coloration. Tenrecs are in the family Tenrecidae. They are a family of small, spiny mammals found in Africa, Madagascar, and the Americas. They resemble hedgehogs, shrews, and moles; however, they are unrelated and have their evolutionary track. Tenrecs can have a unique appearance. They are small and round and can have quills all over their body. They are also covered in fur, which can be either brown or black. Their eyes are large and black, and they have a long snout. Overall, they look like a cross between a hedgehog and a mouse. They can be as small as 1.8 inches in length to as big as 15 inches. The largest species weighs around two pounds. As we now know, the tenrecs are a family of small mammals native to Madagascar. They are in the same order related to other small mammals, such as rodents, rabbits, and moles. However, the family only includes the various tenrec species. The tenrec has undergone much evolution over their existence. They first appeared in Madagascar about 25 million years ago. Since then, they have adapted to their environment and evolved into the creatures we see today. There are many theories about why the tenrec animals have evolved. Some scientists believe it is because of their diet; others think it is because of their ability to reproduce quickly. Tenrecs are generally shy and solitary but can be very active when foraging for food. They eat insects, worms, snails, and other small invertebrates. When they feel threatened, they curl up into a ball, and some can even emit a loud clicking noise to warn predators. They are primarily active at night, so most species have adapted to be blind or have poor eyesight. Tenrecs are found in various habitats in Madagascar, including forests, grasslands, and urban areas. They are adaptable creatures that can survive in both hot and cold climates. Additionally, they can live in both wet and dry environments. Due to their ability to adapt to different conditions, it is challenging to say the ideal habitat for a tenrec. However, they do seem to prefer dense vegetation, as this provides ample hiding places from predators, and they do best in areas with a good amount of food readily available. Tenrecs are insectivores, meaning their diet consists primarily of insects. However, they will also consume other small invertebrates, such as worms and spiders. They can be fed a diet of commercially available insectivore diets and live insects in captivity. Unfortunately, the tenrec is at risk from predators and threats, and due to their small size, they are preyed upon by many different animals. The most common predators include owls, eagles, snakes, fossa, and cats. Additionally, these animals are also threatened by habitat loss and degradation. One of the main predators of the tenrec is the fossa , a unique to Madagascar predatory mammal. The fossa is a sizeable cat-like creature that preys on small mammals like the tenrec. These animals are also at risk from humans who hunt them for their meat or fur. Several things can be done to help protect them and other unique animals only found in Madagascar from becoming extinct. The best place to start is to create protected areas for them to live. Educating people about the importance of these animals is also vital. The best way to help protect the tenrec is to raise awareness about their plight and work to conserve their habitat. We can also support organizations that are working to protect these animals. The female tenrec will birth live young within 61-68 days of gestation and have a litter of up to 10 offspring. This reproductive strategy ensures at least some of the tenrec\u2019s offspring will survive even if conditions are not ideal for raising young. It is just one of the many adaptations that make this animal well-suited to its environment. The tenrec can have anywhere from 1-10 offspring at a time. The average litter size is 3-4. Offspring can be born fully furred and will open their eyes within 11-13 days. They will stay close to their mother for the first few weeks of life and be dependent on her. They are excellent parents and will care for their young until they are old enough to be on their own. There are two main types of tenrec animals: the common tenrec and the greater tenrec. Both kinds reproduce by giving birth to live young. The young tenrecs are born vulnerable and are usually weaned within four weeks. After that, they become independent and start to live on their own. Tenrecs have a relatively short lifespan compared to other animals. The average lifespan is only about 10 years. While this may seem short, it is typical for small mammals like the tenrec. Many small mammals have less than ten years of lifespan due to their high metabolism and lack of defenses against predators and diseases. While their lifespan may be shorter than some other animals, it is typical for their size and species. Some threats include predators, disease, parasites, and humans. According to scientists, the population is hard to determine. However, around 2,500-5,000, individual tenrec animals are in the wild. Most of these animals are found in Madagascar, with smaller populations in other parts of Africa and Asia. They are listed as vulnerable due to their declining population. This decline is mainly due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting pressure from humans. In addition, they are also affected by climate change and disease outbreaks. The good news is that several conservation efforts are underway to help protect them. For example, many organizations are working to raise awareness about this species and its plight. In addition, habitat protection and restoration projects are being carried out in their living areas.",

        "Fun_Fact": "Their jaws can bite through a wooden pencil.",
        "Text": "Have you ever held a beetle that was as large as your hand? Time to meet the Titan Beetle! At over 6 inches long, the Titan Beetle is the largest beetle in the world, and one of the largest insects that we know of. They have strong mandibles and sharp spines to help them defend themselves. While they are large and imposing, these beetles are not aggressive and only act in defense when threatened. The Titan Beetle is known by its scientific name Titanus giganteus . It also happens to be the only species within its genus, Titanus . Due to its unusual size, there aren\u2019t any other beetles that compare and can be classified together with this monstrous insect. It belongs to the Prioninae subfamily within the Cerambycidae family. These beetles are called long-horned beetles because most have long antennas that resemble horns. The Titan Beetle is a great example of this. While there are species within the Cerambycidae family that have longer antennas relative to their overall size, the Titan Beetle\u2019s antennas are still some of the longest. They are part of the Coleoptera order. This includes all beetles , over 400,000 species total. Beetles have hard front wings called elytra. Some are very small, while others such as the Titan Beetle are large. They belong to the Insecta class, Arthropoda phylum , and Animalia kingdom. As their name suggests, Titan Beetles are very, very large . In fact, this is their most easily recognizable characteristic. It\u2019s hard to miss a Titan Beetle! They can grow up to 6.5 inches long. Notable photographs show people holding Titan Beetles. The insects are larger than the person\u2019s hand in some cases. They have curved mandibles at the front of their head, used to snap and bite. These mandibles are sharp and strong enough to bite people when they feel threatened. They aren\u2019t naturally aggressive but do possess plenty of defensive mechanisms, including their bite, that they can use if they are threatened. Titan Beetles are dark brown and have the characteristic hard-shell elytra of all beetles. Because they are so large, these features are easy to see and study. Their antennas curve backward and reach about halfway back on their overall body length. Like all other bugs, they have six legs. They also have sharp spines that they use as a defense against predators. This can also make handling a Titan Beetle a bit challenging. Their mandibles have enough force to snap a pencil in two or bite your hand or finger. Make sure that if you ever do hold a Titan Beetle, you do so with plenty of care. These giant beetles call South America home. They live in tropical rainforests where they hatch, grow through the larvae stage, pupate, and become adults. They spend most of their lives as larvae, although scientists have yet to find a larvae specimen so they aren\u2019t sure exactly how long that period is. Instead, they have found evidence of larvae that they link to Titan Beetles. When they do pupate and become adults, scientists think that they only live a few weeks, just long enough to mate and reproduce. Titan Beetles are found in Brazil , Colombia , Peru , and Ecuador . They are the largest beetle in the Amazon rainforest that we know about and one of the largest insects overall in the world . They live in the tropical rainforest. Scientists believe that the larvae forms eat decaying wood, based on evidence of holes bored through logs that they think belonged to Titan Beetle larvae. These logs are below the ground, showing that these larvae may dig or bore down to get their food. Amazingly, Titan Beetle adults do not eat anything. Even though they are large and capable of flight and movement, they do not seem to need any nourishment in this phase of their lives. Some insects eat everything that they need as larvae and then spend the short period of their adult lives focused on reproducing. Researchers believe that Titan Beetles do the same. Titan Beetles do not pose a threat so it is not necessary to prevent or get rid of them. If you are worried about their bite, just give the Titan Beetle its space. They are not aggressive and will only bite when they feel that they are being threatened. This is most common when they are looking for mates. Fortunately, Titan Beetles hiss to warn you that you are getting too close or that they are starting to get worried. This is meant as a warning and not aggression. Adult Titan Beetles are nocturnal. Some people try to attract Titan Beetles using lights. The males are attracted to light when they fly around at night. Collectors prize these beetles due to their size and status as the largest beetle in the world. Female Titan Beetles are hard to find because they do not fly around looking for mates. Most Titan Beetle specimens are male. Fortunately, this does not impact the population of Titan Beetles because the females are left to lay their eggs. Because Titan Beetles are very large, they cannot squeeze into tight spaces such as the crevices in your home like other beetle species. For the most part, they tend to live their short adult lives away from people. The larvae feed on decaying wood below the ground and are not seen. Loss of habitat is the most significant threat to the Titan Beetle. While they are not listed as endangered, the destruction of the tropical rainforests has a direct impact on Titan Beetles. Without trees in the rainforest, the larvae do not have a food source. Efforts to protect the rainforest are beneficial to Titan Beetles. Goliath Beetle: There are five species within the Goliathus genus known as Goliath Beetles. They can grow up to 4.3 inches long. Goliath Beetles are sometimes raised as pets, eating cat or dog food to get their protein. Hercules Beetle: This rhinoceros beetle also lives in the tropical rainforest and is recognized as the longest beetle in the world. However, the majority of its length is in its horn. It is very strong, which gives it the name Hercules Beetle .",

        "Fun_Fact": "Cockles live quite long; their lifespan usually ranges from 5 to 10 years in the wild.",
        "Text": "Cockles are tiny creatures that fall into the same family as clams found in saltwater. They are very popular because they are edible. Their shells are heart-shaped and packed with soft, salty flesh, which is considered a delicacy in many countries across the world. Another name for cockles is heart clams, and they form part of the Cardiidae family under the genus Cardium, known as bivalve mollusks. These creatures have two valves (two parts). In addition, cockles have over 250 species globally! They occur globally, and range in size from 0.4 to 6 inches, which is very similar to the size of the smooth giant cockle found off the coast of California. They inhabit areas just below low tide levels. However, they can occur at depths of 1,500 feet, and several populations also live in the intertidal zone. While vast populations primarily occur in the Atlantic Ocean, they are found globally. There are multiple types of cockles found along the wet sands of the Atlantic coast, the four most popular being: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The great heart cockle goes by many names, but the most well-known is Atlantic giant cockle. Enthusiasts love finding them because of their distinct heart shapes. In addition, they have a hidden heart that you can see when an intact cockle is turned on its side, and its opening is facing downwards. Plentiful heart cockles are great assets to their ecosystems and help other marine animals. For example, they house tiny crabs inside their shells for protection from predators. As their name suggests, great heart cockles are massive and measure up to 6 inches across, with 30 to 40 radial ribs from edge to edge. Yet, surprisingly, they are the same size as an adult human heart. As their name suggests, the Florida prickly cockle inhabits the coastal shores of southwestern Florida. Unlike other cockle species, their shells have a spiny appearance, hence the name prickly cockle. These creatures are usually brown or salmon in color. However, shell-collecting enthusiasts hunt for unique albino shells, which are very rare. Many people love collecting their shells because they are so small and beautiful. They only measure less than an inch from end to end, which compares to the size of a fingernail, and sometimes smaller. Another cockle found along Florida\u2019s coastline is the Altlantic strawberry cockle. While their populations are vast in this area, they are rare on the beaches. They are narrower than other local species, but their most distinguishing feature is their reddish, rust-colored striping. Yellow cockles are around 2 inches long when fully grown. This measurement is taken across the shell, away from the beak area. Like their name, they are yellow in color and almost circular in shape, with two valves equal in size. The valve\u2019s edges are serrated, and they interlock. In addition, their surface contains 20 to 40 radiating ribs. Some of these ribs (near the beak or umbonal area) are smooth, and others have small spines. Their outer shell is yellowish-white, with pale brownish-red markings, while their inner surface is a beautiful delicate yellow or white. The common cockle\u2019s scientific name is Cerastoderma edule, and they belong to the order Caridiida. Another popular bivalve belongs to this order, the mussel . 1,389 species are members of this order in 203 genera and 7 families. Interestingly, dead Cardiida members form shallow marine sediments. In addition, they have sexual reproduction. Cockles form part of the family Cardiidae, which includes many bivalve mollusk species with an equivalve ribbed shell, distinct umbones, and a big foot that helps them crawl over the ocean floor. In addition, they have much-folded gills. There are ten subfamilies. They include: Cockles live between two shells, hence the name bivalve. When holding one sideways, they have a distinct heart shape. In addition, the shells are ribbed. Their flesh inside the shell is gray, but this varies depending on the species. Cockles can grow up to 0.4 to 6 inches in size; on average, they weigh 0.88 ounces. While cockles look soft and supple, their bodies are actually full of muscle. Therefore, their bodies can be compared to the human tongue regarding strength. They spend their days burrowing in the mud or sand or drifting in the surf. However, cockles are capable of much more. Cockles use their tongue-like foot to kick, which helps them burrow into the sand. In addition, they often stick out their long foot to flip themselves over while relaxing on the surface of the sand. While cockles can open and shut their shells, one of their most distinctive features is their unique ability to close their shells completely. This ability helps keep their squishy flesh from being preyed on by hungry predators. Cockles inhabit soft mud and fine sand in subtidal areas. However, they have a preference when it comes to the sand. Therefore, larger grain size is beneficial, and they are usually found in sand flats and eelgrass beds. They can occur in depths of up to 65 feet in some areas but prefer to inhabit shallow waters. In addition, they also occur in estuaries and can adapt to specific salinity increases. The cockle\u2019s diet is relatively simple. They enjoy consuming microscopic ocean organisms, which they filter through their shells. Cockles are a significant target in their habitats. Many species of marine life like to prey on them. These creatures include: Humans are cockle\u2019s most significant threat because they are collected for commercial purposes. For example, cockles are the main ingredient in baked clams, which is on the menu at most seafood restaurants. They are usually served in their shells, which are the same as the shells most people collect on beaches. However, the ones served in eateries likely originate from a dedicated farm, so they aren\u2019t as unique. Their biggest threats in the wild are marine pollution caused by chemical waste discharge, the destruction of mangrove forests, cockle spats smuggled out of the country, and the use of destructive gear that damages the sea bed. While it\u2019s hard to determine their population size because of their diversity, they are listed as Least Concern on IUCN\u2019s Redlist . Depending on the specie of cockle, their breeding seasons can last several months. Cockle eggs are fertilized when they are shed into the ocean along with sperm. Once the larvae hatch, they start to form and construct their shells and swim freely. Once their shells are fully-formed, they metamorphose at the bottom of the ocean or estuary. Cockles live quite long; their lifespan usually ranges from 5 to 10 years in the wild. Unfortunately, no definitive data is available on the cockle\u2019s population size. Cockles play a significant role in their ecosystem. Because they are filter feeders, they may accumulate bacteria, toxins, and viruses that plague their environment. When harvesting, this is a massive factor, and they should only be eaten if fished from unpolluted areas. In addition, cockles can potentially warn marine biologists about the ecosystem\u2019s health, which is a huge help. As cockles are filter feeders, they provide an essential link in the food chain between the primary producers like phytoplankton and smaller predators like: However, their most important role is their ability to filter water, which helps prevent phytoplankton blooms. This is essential because phytoplankton reduce oxygen availability for fish and thousands of other species. The most significant distinction between a cockle and a clam is that the latter can be found in both freshwater and saltwater habitats, whereas cockles are limited to saltwater. While the term \u2018Cockle\u2019 is used in a specific way, clam is a general name for a number of species. In addition, the general shape of their shells differs considerably. Cockles have a heart-shaped shell covered in ribs. In addition, their shells have very prominent markings, which makes it easy to distinguish them from clams. On the other hand, clams come in multiple sizes and shapes, including circular, triangular, and elongated. Cockles need to be cooked for consumption; however, people can eat clams raw. The best way to prepare cockles is by steaming them with butter and drizzling a lemon dressing over them. Eating a cockle raw can cause severe food poisoning and several other health problems like salmonella . But people tend to prefer cockles to clams because they are more flavorsome. Clams are bigger than cockles; however, both species belong to the clam family, so they also have many similarities. Cockles are a delicacy in many countries; however, they are not as popular as other seafood like oysters and shrimp . This is a pity because they provide a substantial source of nutritional value. Like many other bivalves, cockles have a chewy texture and salty-sweet taste. There is no limit to the magnitude of the cockle\u2019s nutritional value. For example, their most significant dietary source is vitamin B12. Just 3.5 ounces of cockle measures up to: Sacrificing 79 calories for all these nutrients seems like an easy choice. Unfortunately, many marine species that we consume are incredibly high in mercury. In fact, mercury is present in all seafood to a degree. However, it\u2019s highest in larger animals like: If humans ingest too much mercury, it starts to dissolve the tissue and is often absorbed by the intestinal tissue. Absorbing large amounts of inorganic mercury causes bloody diarrhea. In addition, it can spread to other organ systems, affecting mental capacity, and resulting in memory loss, renal damage, and mood swings. There is an excellent source of protein in cockles; the amount of protein per calorie is highly impressive. In addition, cockles only contain 79 calories per 3.5-ounce serving, making the protein-per-calorie ratio astronomical! Like other shellfish species, one of the disadvantages of consuming cockles is that they can cause foodborne illnesses. Cockles are filter feeders and can accumulate bacteria, leading to infections like vibriosis, hepatitis A, and salmonella. That\u2019s why ensuring they are cooked properly before consumption is vital. Before cooking any shellfish, adhere to the Washington State Department of Health\u2019s guide on handling, cooking, and storing cockles, as well as other shellfish. Generally, when cooking cockles, their internal temperature should reach 145\u00b0F for at least 15 seconds.",

        "Text": "Scorpion Fish has sharp spines that are covered in poisonous mucus that allow them to attack if necessary. The scorpionfish, also known as Scorpaenidae, is a large family of fishes and usually includes hundreds of members. Most fishes from this family are venomous and can sting predators to defend themselves. The sting from this fish can cause intense pain and can also cause swelling. It is said that the venom from the sting can spread to other parts of the body quickly, requiring fast medical attention. These fishes usually exist at a depth of around 800 meters in the littoral zone and are often known to be motionless around rocks and algae. The Scorpion fishes go by the scientific name Scorpaenidae and belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata. They come from the class and order Actinopterygii and Scorpaeniformes respectively. There are about 100 to 200 subspecies and types of Scorpionfish. The scientific name Scorpaenidae comes from New Latin, combining Scorpaena and the suffix -idae. Scorpaena can be traced back to the Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1, which comes from the Greek word for scorpion . Interestingly, the Greek word for Scorpion is rooted in the Proto-Indo-European verb (s)ker, which means \u201cto cut.\u201d See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles .

The scorpionfish, which is also called a rockfish, belongs to a family of fish that is believed to have evolved during the mid-Miocene period, around 15.97 million to 11.6 million years ago. Based on fossil information discovered, it is believed that this species began to diversify in the late Miocene. Scorpionfishes make up one of the largest marine families and consist of 100 to 200 different fish family members. Some of the more popular species include lionfish , firefish, turkey fish, stingfish, and stonefish. The stonefish is the deadliest species of Scorpaenidae. Each of these is then broken down into multiple types within their own families. Presently, there are a total of 10 subfamilies, though 338 species fall into these categories, according to reports in 2018. However, the total amount will vary, based on where you get your information. Scorpionfishes have longer bodies while stone fishes have more of a round body shape. Meanwhile, the scorpionfishes have eyes that protrude, and the stone fishes have eyes that dig deeper down into their skulls. Another difference between the scorpionfish and the stonefish is that the former has a forward sitting jaw while the latter has a more upturned, grumpier-looking one. Scorpionfishes have long bodies that are covered in feather-laden fins. They have skin flaps that also help them easily camouflage and blend in with their surroundings. Some scorpionfishes are brown or yellow, while others exhibit bright colors like red or orange. They are known to become almost invisible when they are near reefs and rocks. The size of the scorpionfish is about 8 inches to 12 inches, and it weighs around 3.4 pounds. They are usually motionless while near algae or rocks and also have venomous spines that are sharp and covered in poisonous mucous. The scorpionfishes are usually found in the Indo-Pacific regions and also inhibit the tropical underwater of the Indian ocean. Apart from that, these fishes are also found in the central and western parts of the Pacific Ocean and also in several parts of Indonesia. These fishes usually exist where there are plenty of coral reefs and the temperature of the water is temperate. This is because the right temperatures help them survive better and the coral reefs help these fishes hide from predators efficiently. The population of the scorpionfish is not known. However, fishes belonging to these families do exist in large numbers as more than 200 fishes are part of this family. They are, however, \u2018not extinct\u2019 as listed by the NOAA. Even though the scorpionfishes themselves are poisonous and dangerous, they still fall prey to some of the sea creatures including large snappers, rays, and sharks. With so few predators, the scorpionfish can thrive greatly when it releases thousands of eggs to be fertilized. Still, this fish is dominant in its own right, so the predators that come after it must be equally threatening. Meanwhile, they also feed on certain creatures including small fishes and snails. They also feed on crustaceans and coral reefs. Humans can become a victim of their sting , which will require immediate medical attention. While waiting for emergency services, the wound needs to be cleaned with the hottest water that the skin can handle for at least 30 minutes. These fishes are oviparous. The female scorpionfishes often produce transparent or greenish eggs. The eggs, as well as the sperms from the female and male scorpionfishes respectively, are released in the water and stay afloat near the surface of the water, where they are later attached. However, other than that, not much is known about the mating process of these fishes. The lifespan of these fishes is usually about 15 years. Even though these fishes are not commonly caught because of the venom they carry around, some people do fish them out and also cook them. Scorpionfishes are safe to consume and are also world-famous delicacies. Scorpionfish chips are very famous, and most people compare the flavor to a combination of sea bass and monkfish . The easiest place to fish for them is in the South Pacific Ocean since they are commonly found in coral reefs. Still, fishers should be careful while fishing around these reefs so that they don\u2019t destroy the local environment. There is no shortage of recipes online for scorpionfish, depending on the species that is prepared. Due to their lack of meat, the cooking process doesn\u2019t take long, and most dishes are ready within a matter of 10 minutes or less. When cooked properly, it doesn\u2019t quite have the flakiness that some other fish do, but it is also incredibly tender. Their thin meat absorbs other flavors well, much like any other crustacean. Anyone looking to prepare scorpionfish at home will want to stock up on some butter and spices, regardless of the recipe chosen. To get the maximum flavor, try out the pan-roasted method seen here .",

        "Text": "Prehistoric pigs like the Daeodon looked nothing like the farmyard pigs we know today. The Daeodon lived during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs, around 23-20 million years ago. It was much larger than modern-day pigs and not actually related to them at all. Instead, it is more closely related to hippos . Learn more about these gigantic omnivores that were some of the earliest mammals . Daeodon shoshonensis is the species that is part of the Daeodon genus. The name Daeodon is derived from the Greek words for \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cteeth\u201d for the Daeodons large and powerful teeth. Known simply as Daeodon , another similar species was initially called Dinohyus . When researchers realized that they were the same, they both fell under the already established Daeodon name. You may still read Dinohyus in some texts, however. Daeodon is a member of the Entelodontidae family. They are referred to as Entelodonts and include other pig-like mammals that lived between 38 and 19 million years ago. All Entelodonts, including the Daeodon, are now extinct . Daeodon belongs to the Artiodactyla order. This means that they are even-toed ungulates that put their weight on an even number of toes (in this case, two toes, the third and fourth) when they walk. The other toes might or might not be present or functioning. There are also odd-toed ungulates that bear weight on an odd number of toes. Among even-toed ungulates are pigs, hippos, deer, giraffes, camels, llamas, sheep, goats, cattle and the like. The ancestry of the Artiodactyla order is not known exactly, but fossils show that even-toed ungulates existed as far back as 53 million years ago in the early Eocene period. Fossils of the same age have appeared in Europe, Asia, and North America. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . While modern pigs and hogs can get large, the Daeodon was even bigger. It walked on all fours and still stood about 5.8 feet tall, measured at the shoulder. The skull was around 3 feet long and represented a large portion of the overall body. Daeodons were the largest of the Entelodonts and formidable during their lifetime. Their large heads were supported by muscles attached to their vertebrae, similar to bison or rhinoceroses . Their necks were small compared to their head. Overall, they had a hunched appearance and their snout was low to the ground. They had strong jaws, especially the males, and space for large muscles in their cheeks. This likely helped them eat and defend themselves and may have even played a role in competing for mates. Daeodons had long limbs. The front legs were fused, like many other Entelodonts. Their hunched appearance looks much like a bison, with the tallest portion of the body at the shoulders. Researchers do not know very much about their skin and whether it had scales, feathers, fur, or something else. They do know that Daeodons were mammals. Because they were warm-blooded, they likely had some sort of covering to help regulate their body temperature or lived in temperate climates. The Daeodons were omnivores. Fragments of their fossils and teeth show that they had teeth suited for tearing into meat as well as teeth made for grinding plants. This is characteristic of Entelodonts. Their teeth and jaws were strong enough to bite bone, with bite marks shown in other preserved bones from the period matched to their bite. Researchers don\u2019t know exactly what Daeodon ate. On the one hand, their snouts were low to the ground which may have made it hard for them to take down prey. They were efficient runners, however, and could have outrun some herbivores of the time. Scientists believe that they had similar eating habits to modern-day bears . They would eat just about anything that was convenient and provided them with the nutrients they needed. This could have included small prey, prey killed by other predators, plants, vines, and berries. Daeodon fossils show that they lived during the end of the Oligocene and the start of the Miocene epochs, around 20 million years ago. This point of transition shows that these animals experienced many changes in their environment that likely led to their extinction . Fragments have been discovered in Oregon as well as Nebraska. The Agate Fossil Beds National Monument in Nebraska is well-known for being the site of many fossilized early mammals. The Age of Mammals display shows how these creatures lived together as well as what animals may have existed in the same epochs. During their time, Daeodons lived in the vast grassland of these areas. Their habitat ranged from river beds to drier areas. This led to their adaptation to eating both plants and animals to survive. The changing climate also impacted their survival and ultimately their extinction. Larger carnivores likely posed a threat to Daeodon. Although, due to their size, it probably wasn\u2019t as significant as the threat of decreasing food supply, changing habitat, and competition for resources and mates with other Daeodons. Scientists think that the large cheek muscles on the male specimens show that they engaged in fights for mates, either by posturing or actually physically fighting with each other. Those aspects are not present in the female specimens. Beardogs were some of the largest carnivores during this period. They were similar to wolves or hyenas and even lived in packs. While they were not as large as the Daeodon, they could have eaten young, old, or sick Daeodon that were weak. Unlike other prehistoric animals like dinosaurs, Daeodon was a mammal and likely gave birth to live young. When they were young, Daeodon were particularly vulnerable to predators. They did not have the same strong musculature or imposing presence that the adults had. Older, wounded, or ill Daeodon may have also been easier prey. The first Daeodon fragments were found in Oregon. But it wasn\u2019t until much later, starting in the 1940s, that researchers began to put together a more complete picture of this animal\u2019s description, life, and evolution. Some of the most interesting discoveries of ancient mammals, including the Daeodon, were made in Nebraska. A complete skeleton originally called Dinohyus was discovered in Nebraska\u2019s Agate Fossil beds. Later, researchers realizes that it matched other specimens of a species they had named Daeodon. Because the earliest naming is used for all subsequent naming, the new skeleton was reclassified as a Daeodon. Daeodon discoveries are rare, making the complete skeleton specimen very valuable for researchers who want to know more about this ancient mammal. Entelodonts went extinct in the early Miocene, around 16 million years ago. This included the gigantic Daeodon. Temperatures during this time increased, leading to drier climates. As the climate changed, so did the vegetation and the entire food chain. Although Daeodons were able to eat both plants and meat, they did not adapt fast enough to survive this period of change in earth\u2019s history. Scientists do not know exactly when the Daeodon went extinct, but they can use specimens of other similar animals to determine what types of species were able to evolve to survive and which ones did not. This included the Daeodon and all other Entelodonts. Even though they look like some modern animals, including warthogs , bison, and pigs, these animals are not descended from Daeodon.",

        "Text": "The Hobo Spider is a kind of spider that designs funnel webs and often travels from city to city. Hence, its name became Hobo Spider. Like its traveling preferences, its genus was also changed quite a few times. It was considered to be a flesh-eating insect in the olden days but after research, scientists have fallen into a debate on whether it is a harmful spider or not. Although it has been identified numerous times, its physical description is quite hard to decode because spiders often vary in their appearances. The Hobo Spider (Eratigena agrestis) belongs to the Family Agelenidae and comes from the order Araneae. Formerly, it was regarded as the Tegenaria agrestis; before that, it was in the Genus Aranea because of its likeness to the European habitat. But in 2013, the Genus for the Hobo Spider was finally have been thought to be Eratigena . The Hobo Spider is also commonly known as the funnel web spider. But it is not the same as the Australian funnel web spider, more commonly referred to as the funnel web spider. The exact population size of the Hobo Spiders is unknown. However, in a study conducted on these spiders, there was an estimate found. The Utah Plant Pest Diagnostic Lab has been keeping track of the number of Hobo Spiders since the late 70s. Out of the 13,500 samples that have been submitted in a specific time, 639 of them were Hobo Spiders. So, it may be a stretch to think there are only 639 of the Hobo Spiders that exist. But in a sample of insects and mites, the Hobo Spiders are within the range of 4 to 6% which itself is a significant number in the spider population. As for its species, only one has been discovered until now. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . As mentioned before, it is hard to identify spiders from a distance. They do have distinctive features but are visible only if you see them through a microscope. Secondly, these physical attributes are better understood by an arachnologist. They are usually brown in color but may range from light to dark brown among various Hobo Spiders. A dark center line is seen running down vertical of the body to the center along with lighter stripes running on both ends of the body. You will also find yellow markings on the body but that is quite general with many spiders and they vary in color quite often. They are called chevrons and are pointed towards the head in a V shape. However, these markings are not quite visible to the naked eye and if you do spot a Hobo Spider with such a distinctive feature, there are more chances of it being a juvenile Hobo Spider. The Hobo Spider is oblong-shaped and has a segregated thorax and an abdomen. At the near end, you will find two spinnerets but there is no antenna on the body. It measures about one-fourth of an inch and sometimes one-half inch in length. However, it is to note that the male adults are shorter than the female adults. The spider has long and slender legs attached to the upper body region or thorax. They are 8 in number and do not have any bands on them. They can run pretty quickly but are unable to climb on walls or other such surfaces. You will find them usually hidden in their webs which are either tube-shaped or funnel-like. Hence, the reason they are also called funnel web spiders. These are all general features that may also be found in other kinds of spiders. This is why to be sure about their identification, you will need to be on the search for the following attributes that are only visible under a microscope. Their behavior is mainly solitary. They live in isolation on their webs or in hiding. But they won\u2019t come charging at you in the form of groups like you usually see in movies. They are only found together when they are mating. Their ground for mating is the web that the adult Hobo Spiders built for themselves. The females wait for the males to arrive at this mating ground. Once it is done, the male goes away but eventually dies. The Hobo Spiders are usually found in America, European countries, Canada , and Mexico. They usually prefer the warmer climate. When it is the cold season, you can either find them hidden somewhere warm or in people\u2019s houses. If you were to be specific, then you would find them in places that contain crevices, holes, or cracks that would allow the formation of their webs. Their legs may not help them much in climbing but they do work well on uneven surfaces like clothing, carpets, stairs, and such. Like a funnel, they design their webs and allow their prey to slowly fall into their twisted trap. You can find them in the months of August till October hidden with fellow Hobo Spiders to mate. This is when the two genders mate but only one comes out alive near the end. The male dies while the female lives on to lay eggs. Another thing that is quite interesting about these Spiders is that they might be considered aggressive by some people. However, they might be of that nature mostly due to defense. A Hobo Spider has a very simple way of hunting. Its web is the main element in its intent to kill. Whenever a prey is trapped in the web, a vibration runs through the web alerting the Hobo Spider of its meal for the day. This technique is more towards surviving rather than hunting with the predator sense. The main insects trapped in the web are ground insects like flies, ants , and cockroaches. They will gobble up anything that sets foot into their tunnel-shaped web. This is why they live in survival mode. Its predators include the Praying Mantis (Mantis religiosa) and the Yellow-legged Mud-Dauber Wasp (Sceliphron caementarium). Although some wasps target the Hobo Spider, the Praying Mantis is one predator that is a big threat to the Hobo Spider. They are also used widely for eliminating the Hobo Spiders from certain communities. Hobo Spiders are not aggressive or dangerous. They may attack a human if provoked but that stays true for any animal. Since Hobo Spiders are usually found around in houses, they have a higher tendency to come in contact with a human. Hence, it may attack a human but whether they are poisonous or not is still under debate. In the past, there were two or more cases that suggested Hobo Spiders caused necrosis. But as per today\u2019s research, there have only been two cases of Hobo Spider bites but the only symptoms were redness and itching. However, a spider bite is hard to identify because the spider is harder to recognize. This is why the matter still remains a mystery.

        "Diet": "Omnivore that enjoys snails and especially likes slugs, insects, fungus",
        "Fun_Fact": "Found inhabiting dense woodland and caves!",
        "Text": "Glowworms are a group of light-producing insects that emit a brilliant glow. Many people appreciate their strange ethereal beauty, but there are a lot of misconceptions and confusion about what this insect actually is. For a start, the name itself is a huge misnomer. It is not really a worm at all. Instead, \u201cglowworm\u201d is kind of a catch-all term that describes a larva (which resembles a worm) with a glowing body. Adding to the confusion, several species of insects, including both larval and adult stages, are called glowworms as well. The ability to produce light through entirely organic means is called bioluminescence . The glow usually aims to attract a mate, capture prey, or warn away predators. If you\u2019ve spotted a glowing insect, then it\u2019s almost certainly a species of beetle (though some gnats can produce light as well). This article will discuss many different types of glowworms, including both the larval and adult forms of some species. As mentioned previously, \u201cglowworm\u201d is a somewhat confusing catch-all term. While several species of insects and/or larvae are called glowworms, it\u2019s not really a scientific term and doesn\u2019t neatly correspond to any taxonomical classification. \u201cGlowworm\u201d can refer to many different species, some of them only loosely or not at all related to each other. The only commonality between them is their bioluminescent ability. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Bioluminescence in animals, including marine animals, evolved in different ways and for different purposes. Some of the illumination functions for attracting mates and some to help capture prey. Glowworms generally fall into two broad categories: they are either beetles or they\u2019re fungus gnats. The glowing insects most people are familiar with, including the fireflies, true glowworms, and lightning bugs, are part of the beetle family called Lampyridae (though in fireflies, it\u2019s mostly the larvae that are called glowworms). Another closely related family called Phengodidae also contains many species called glowworm beetles. The fungus gnats, by contrast, are completely different from the beetles. They\u2019re more closely related to flies within the order of Diptera. From an evolutionary perspective, their bioluminescent adaption evolved separately from the beetles. These glowworms have a totally different approach to using illumination in order to capture food. They are able to produce and lower sticky webs from their bodies from cave roofs. The fungus gnats\u2019 illumination capability is believed to have evolved separately in each of the three groups. These insects vary quite dramatically in size and appearance. Each type seems to have its own unusual quirks and strange facts. The bioluminescent glow is the common feature among them. This light can be emitted as a series of flashes or as a constant glow, and it ranges in color between green, yellow, orange, and blue. Bioluminescence is produced by a chemical reaction involving a light-emitting pigment. The nature of this chemical reaction varies from one group to another. As mentioned previously, glowworm usually refers to the larval stage of a glowing insect. But there are entire species that have acquired the name of glowworm as well. The common European glowworm (a species of long, narrow beetles within the firefly family of Lampyrida) is one of the more well-known examples. Unlike the closely related fireflies, only the female of this species is actually capable of producing light, at least after reaching their adult form. She is a type of larviform, meaning she has retained many larval characteristics into adulthood and therefore lacks wings. When the mating season arrives around June and July, she will climb up on a plant and produce a bright glow continuously to attract one of the winged males. His large, photosensitive eyes can see the light from up to 50 yards away. The brightness is itself a sign of the number of eggs she\u2019s carrying. Therefore, the male glowworms, who only measure about half her size, will try to mate with the brightest females. These insects are found in many different environments all over the world. Depending on the species, their habitat includes forests, grasslands, meadows, and even gardens. By contrast, the larval glowworms of the fungus gnats are mostly found in caves or rock cavities. Most of these insects are actually carnivorous. Even the species that primarily use their bioluminescence for reproductive purposes tend to eat meat. These insects provide a stable source of food for many different birds , mammals , reptiles , amphibians , spiders, and other insects . There are almost too many predators to even name. Many of these insects tend to be predatory in nature, and their means of feeding can be quite gruesome. Fungus gnats, as mentioned previously, use their bioluminescence to trap their prey in silky threads. Some also live up to their names by consuming fungi. The larva of the common European glowworm, by contrast, has the ability to inject a toxic digestive fluid into its prey (usually slugs and snails ). This fluid will gradually paralyze and liquefy its victim, so the larva can easily lap up the remains without a struggle. Because the prey is often multiple times larger than the actual larva, it provides quite a meal. The larval beetle needs to be a voracious eater because once it reaches adulthood, it lives on the fat reserves and barely eats anything at all. Once it reproduces, it has effectively reached the end of its life cycle.",

        "Text": "Fishing spiders are part of the genus Dolomedes and are found near water sources such as ponds, lakes, and streams. They get their name from their hunting behavior; they sit on the edge of a body of water and wait for prey to come close enough to snatch it up with their long, powerful legs. Fishing spiders are excellent swimmers and have even been known to dive underwater in pursuit of prey. Scientifically known as Dolomedes , fishing spiders are members of the Pisauridae family, which can be found worldwide. The fishing spider is sometimes known by other names, such as the raft spider, the dock spider, the wharf spider, and the water spider, and it hunts its prey close to or in water sources. Their scientific name, Dolomedes , is greek and translates to \u201cdeceitful.\u201d Their family name, Pisauridae, translates to \u201cswift at sea.\u201d The fishing spider is sometimes confused with the wolf spider due to their similarities in appearance. However, a fishing spider is distinguished by its larger size and horizontal rows of eyes. The fishing spider can appear brown but ranges from black to light brown and has bands of colors or markings across its body. They have 8 long, extended legs that can range between 2 to 4 inches in diameter. Male fishing spiders are much smaller than the females. Male fishing spiders\u2019 bodies are only around a quarter inch in diameter, and females are around 1 inch in diameter. Male fishing spiders can also weigh up to 14 times less than females. Fishing spiders have 8 eyes, with 4 on each side of their head. As they spend a lot of time in and around water, their bodies are also waterproof and covered in fur. Fishing spiders are a type of spider that has evolved to be able to live and hunt near water. They have developed several adaptations that allow them to do this, such as specialized hairs on their bodies that help them sense vibrations in the water. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . While there isn\u2019t much information on the evolution of fishing spiders, they are believed to have evolved from land-dwelling spiders, who began moving into aquatic habitats a few million years ago. Over time, they developed the adaptations mentioned above, which allowed them to better survive and thrive in these environments. Today, there are over 100 different species of fishing spiders found all over the world! Fishing spiders are known for their ability to walk on water, and they use this skill to hunt their prey and sense vibrations through the water. These spiders differ from other spiders in that they do not construct webs to catch their prey. Instead, they will sit and wait at the edge of a body of water for an unsuspecting insect to come by, using the water and the vibrations they can feel on it as a web of sorts. When one does, the spider will quickly dart out and grab it with its powerful legs. Fishing spiders are also excellent swimmers and can even dive underwater to catch their prey. They have particular adaptations that allow them to stay submerged for long periods and float on top of the water\u2019s surface. The fishing spider is known for being one of the few types of spiders that can survive being submerged in water for long periods. It can breathe trapped air through delicate pores in its exoskeleton. Another interesting behavior of the fishing spider is that it sometimes uses leaves or other bits of floating vegetation as a raft. This raft helps the spider float on the water\u2019s surface and extend its hunting range. Fishing spiders are found in various habitats, including wetlands, woodlands, and even near urban areas . They are often found near water sources, such as ponds and streams. They can be found worldwide and live in various climates, although they are more common in Asia, North America, and Europe. Fishing spiders are also known to build their webs near water sources to protect their eggs. They can usually be found hiding under rocks or logs near water when they\u2019re not hunting or swimming. Fishing spiders are opportunistic hunters and will take whatever prey is available. Fishing spiders are predators that hunt by waiting for prey to come close enough to be grabbed. They will also actively search for prey, using their long legs to walk across the surface of ponds and streams. Fishing spiders are typically hunted by larger animals, like birds or snakes. Some arthropod species, such as centipedes and scorpions , may also prey on the fishing spider. Other predators of the fishing spider can include bats, large frogs, and fish. Fishing spiders are predators that hunt their prey in or near water. They eat anything they can catch, including insects, fish, frogs, and even occasionally small mammals. One of the main predators of fishing spiders is the bird known as the kingfisher. Kingfishers are small to medium-sized birds with large heads, long bills, and short legs that are known for hunting fish. They are excellent hunters and can spot a fishing spider from a distance as it sits on a leaf or twig near water. When they see one, they will swoop down and snatch it up in their beak before it has a chance to escape. Other predators of fishing spiders include bats, snakes , frogs, fish, and other spiders. However, kingfishers are these eight-legged hunters\u2019 most common and feared predators. Fishing spiders typically reproduce once a year, in the late summer or early fall. The males will spin a web and then vibrate it to attract females. If a female is interested, she will approach the male, and they will mate. The male fishing spider is much smaller than the female. When fishing spiders mate, the male deposits his sperm into the female\u2019s reproductive system. Researchers have discovered that after depositing the sperm, the males generally die due to swelling of their genitals. The female will typically lay over 1,000 eggs at one time. The eggs are laid in an egg sack which the female spider carries around by attaching to her body until a few days before the eggs hatch. Then the female will build a nursery using her webbing to keep the eggs safe before they hatch. After the eggs have hatched, the spiderlings will climb onto her back. Once they have hatched, the spiderlings will stay with their mother for only a few days before heading out on their own. Once mating has occurred, the female will lay her eggs in a silken cocoon and attach them to a plant or other object near water. She will then guard her eggs until they hatch, at which point she will help her young climb onto her back so they can be safely carried. Baby fishing spiders are called spiderlings. The spiderlings will climb onto their mother\u2019s back and hitch a ride until they are big enough to venture out independently. Hundreds of baby fishing spiders will ride on their mother\u2019s back in a cluster. Once they leave their mother\u2019s side, they immediately start hunting for food. Fishing spiders are known for their excellent hunting skills, even as adolescents. They use their keen sense of touch and taste to locate prey, then pounce on it with lightning speed. Their venomous bite is strong enough to kill small prey like insects and even frogs. Baby fishing spiders are just as skilled at hunting as their adult counterparts. However, they tend to hunt smaller prey due to their size. Fishing spiders are known to have a relatively long life span for spiders, living up to 2-3 years in the wild. In comparison, most common spider species only live around one year. However, they face many threats during their lifetime, including predators, disease, and environmental changes. These threats include, but are not limited to: The population of fishing spiders varies depending on the location and can be difficult to calculate. In North America, there are an estimated 10 million fishing spiders. However, the population in Europe is unknown. There is not much official population information available on fishing spiders. Still, we do know that they are found in a variety of habitats and that their population is doing well overall. Fishing spiders are an essential part of the ecosystem and keep insect populations under control. Fishing spiders are not considered endangered or threatened at this time.",

        "Text": "One of the most venomous fish in the world, the stonefish, is a ray-finned fish in the family Scorpaenidae. They are a bottom-dwelling fish found throughout the Indo-Pacific. Instead of scales, it features warts and growths of algae all over its body. It uses camouflage to avoid predators and often appears like a rock resting on the ocean floor. Unlike most fish, it can survive out of water for up to 24 hours and live between 5 and 10 years in the wild. The stonefish belongs to the scorpionfish family Scorpaenidae. In total, there are 5 species that go by the name, all of which belong to the genus Synanceia . Synanceia verrucosa, also known as the reef stonefish, or simply stonefish, is the most common species within the genus. That said, scientists recognize the estuarine stonefish ( Synanceia horrida) as the type species of the genus. The other species in the genus include the midget stonefish ( Synanceia alula ), the Red Sea stonefish ( Synanceia nana ), and Synanceia platyrhyncha. The genus name, Synanceia , derives from the Greek words syn, meaning \u201cwith,\u201d and angeion , meaning \u201ccavity,\u201d which alludes to the large, cavernous head common among all stonefish. Meanwhile, the species name, verrucosa , translates to \u201ccovered with warts,\u201d in reference to the warty growths that grow on their body. Most stonefish appear rather drab, which helps them to blend in with rocks on the bottom of the ocean floor. They typically look either brownish-gray or reddish-brown, although some parts look yellow, orange, or green. Unlike most fish, they lack scales, and their bodies are covered in warts and growths of algae. They possess small, upward-set eyes, behind each of which rests a deep pit. The head is wide and flat, while the mouth is large and practically vertical. They can grow up to 24 inches long, although most typically measure between 14 and 20 inches. Meanwhile, they have a maximum weight of 5 pounds. Aside from its skin, the stonefish\u2019s most distinguishing feature is its long dorsal spines. The dorsal fin contains between 12 and 14 spines and 5 to 7 soft rays. These spines all measure the same length and have venom glands located at their base. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Unlike some venomous species, which try to scare off predators with flashy colors, stonefishes rely on camouflage. Their drab colors and warty appearance makes them look like rocks when they rest on the bottom of the ocean floor. They are bottom-dwellers that do not actively search for their prey, opting instead to lie in wait for their food to come to them. In addition, they do not seek out the company of other stonefishes except to mate, living most of their lives in solitude. Their calm, quiet demeanor \u2013 along with their dangerous reputation \u2013 makes them popular aquarium attractions. You can find them throughout the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean . Their range extends from India to Papua New Guinea and from southern Japan to Australia . Some species, such as the Red Sea stonefish, live in and around the Red Sea and along the coasts of East Africa . In recent years, stonefishes have been spotted in the Mediterranean and were likely introduced after people released them from aquariums. Stonefishes are benthic fish that spend most of their lives on the ocean floor. They prefer shallow, tropical waters to deeper, more temperate waters. You can often find them living in or around coral reefs , which provide plenty of cover from predators and access to food. They typically rest either on rocks or plants or directly on the seabed. Despite their potent venom, several animals still manage to prey on this fish. Their main predators include sharks , stingrays , eels , and sea snakes . These animals can eat stonefish while avoiding their venomous spines. Young ones are especially susceptible to predation. All stonefish are nocturnal predators that prey on other marine animals. Their diet primarily consists of shrimp , other crustaceans, and small fish. Rather than actively hunting for food, they rely on ambush tactics to catch their prey. They sit motionlessly, wait for animals to swim by, and then swallow their prey. Despite their seemingly calm nature, they can strike at incredible speeds. According to records, some specimens can strike within 0.015 seconds. Outside of the mating season, stonefish are primarily solitary. Even during the mating season, they come together for only a short time before going their separate ways. Sexually mature females lay their unfertilized eggs in the soft substrate in and around coral reefs. Males then swim by and release their sperm to fertilize the eggs. Stonefishes display a high level of promiscuity, as females tend not to discriminate between which males they allow to fertilize their eggs. Their eggs measure quite large, and the larvae are already quite well-developed upon hatching. Although few live to adulthood, those that do enjoy a life expectancy between 5 and 10 years. The stonefish ranks as one of if not the most venomous fish in the world. Each of its dorsal spines contains two venom sacs which produce a potent toxin. Even in small quantities, stonefish venom can wreak havoc on the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. Just 18 milligrams can prove fatal and represents just half of the venom a single stonefish can release. Symptoms of their stings include intense pain, paralysis, shock, and tissue death. Common medical treatments include anti-venom and anesthetics for the pain. With treatment, symptoms still tend to persist for 24 to 48 hours, and some victims suffer long-term nerve damage or muscle atrophy. The main threat to stonefishes comes from human activity. They make their homes in coral reefs, many of which are under threat due to climate change and environmental pollution. In addition, stonefishes are often captured for use in the pet trade as aquarium attractions. However, some cultures consume them as food, particularly in the Philippines , China , and Japan . People often cook stonefish with ginger in soups and sometimes eat them raw as part of sushi or sashimi. Although few stonefish live to adulthood, they are still relatively common fish. Their use in commercial fishing is also limited, which has helped keep stonefish populations stable. While the continued destruction of coral reefs may affect their populations in the future, no species shows significant signs of decline at this time. As a result, the IUCN lists them as a species of Least Concern .",

Camel spiders can be found in areas with dry climates throughout the world \u2013 including the Middle East, Mexico, and the southwestern area of the United States. Also known as wind scorpions, sun spiders, and solifuges, camel spiders tend to dwell in deserts and scrublands. This animal is a carnivore that eats rodents, small birds, insects, and lizards. Furthermore, the camel spider\u2019s bite is very painful to humans. Solifugids, often known as camel spiders, are a mysterious order of arachnids that are indigenous to deserts all over the world (pretty much everywhere except in Australia and Antarctica). It is estimated that there are about 1,100 species, the majority of which have not been researched. Camel Spiders in North America: Systematic Revision and Biogeography of a Little-Known Taxon. Solifuges , often known as camel spiders, are a significant group of arachnids that live in delicate, frequently in danger desert habitats. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Camel spiders will avoid the sun, and throughout the day they will look for either cover from the sun or a site where they may dig a burrow. A camel spider will, nevertheless, be drawn to light at night and go towards it. Camel spiders belong to the Solifugae family and the class Arachnida. Although this animal goes by a few other names including wind scorpion, camel spiders are neither scorpions nor true spiders. Based on a common myth that it eats the insides of a camel\u2019s stomach, camel spiders are the subject of many exaggerated stories. The camel stomach legend is not true -but the name has stuck with it despite the busted myth, making the name camel spider a bit misleading. There are more than 1,000 species of this spider. Galeodes arab, Galeodes caspius , Galeodes granti , and Paragaleodes are just a few examples. Camel spiders are tan and dark brown in color with small hairs on their bodies. The fine hairs on the body of a camel spider help to insulate it from the desert heat. The coloration of a camel spider helps it to blend into the dry, hot environment around them. This can help it stay clear of predators. While it has eight legs, some people mistakenly think it has ten because camel spiders have two long pedipalps (a second pair of appendages) near their mouths. They use these to find and pull in their prey. The camel spider\u2019s size ranges from 3 to 6 inches long. It weighs about two ounces. If you put three golf tees on the ground end to end you would be looking at the length of a six-inch camel spider. Hold a tennis ball in your hand and you are holding something that\u2019s about the same weight as a two-ounce camel spider. The camel spider is one of the biggest spiders in the world. Camel spiders can move quickly through their desert or scrubland habitat. The fastest they can go is 10 mph \u2013 which, while not slow, is only about one-fifth as fast as a rabbit. The next time you hop in the car, watch the speedometer as it moves up to 10 mph, this will give you a solid idea of how fast this animal moves! Some people believe that camel spiders chase humans in order to bite them. This is a myth. Yes, a camel spider may follow a human, but the spider is not following the person in order to bite them. In fact, the spider probably doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s following a human. You see, a person casts a long shadow. Camel spiders have been known to follow people in order to enjoy the coolness of their shadows in the hot environments in which they live. There\u2019s a good chance that a person who sees a camel spider following them will start to run and the spider may decide to speed up in order to stay inside the person\u2019s shadow! Fortunately, most humans can outrun this spider \u2013 although it is a fast one. Camel spiders are solitary except during mating season. They can also be aggressive if they feel threatened but are rarely seen by humans since they are mostly nocturnal. Camel spiders live in the Middle East, the southwestern United States, and Mexico. They live in hot, dry deserts and scrublands. Camel spiders hide in crevices between rocks as well as under logs to keep cool when daytime temperatures reach their highest. They hunt at night when the temperatures are cooler. Water is scarce in the desert, so camel spiders get most of the liquid they need to survive when they eat their prey. These animals don\u2019t migrate. They live in the desert or scrubland throughout their short lives. What do camel spiders eat? These animals are carnivores. Some of their prey include lizards , small birds , gerbils , beetles , snakes , and termites . This arachnid can even eat prey that is larger than itself. Like many other creatures, camel spiders will eat whatever prey is most plentiful in their environment. Camel spiders can sense prey with their pedipalps and grab them with their jaws. They use their own digestive juices to turn their prey into a pulpy liquid that they can consume. Yuck! Sometimes there\u2019s not much food available for camel spiders in deserts and scrublands. So, these animals store fat in their bodies to nourish them during those times when they can\u2019t find prey. Camel spiders have a few predators including toads , scorpions , and bats . These three predators are nocturnal. So, they are active at the same time camel spiders are out hunting for prey. A bat using echolocation can find a camel spider and swoop down to pick it up for a meal. A scorpion can overpower a camel spider and eat it . There are also some desert toads that are as large or larger as camel spiders, so they are also capable of capturing one of these spiders to eat. One major threat to camel spiders is starvation. If they can\u2019t find prey in the desert and aren\u2019t able to store up any fat, they can die of starvation. However, the official conservation status of camel spiders is least concern . During the breeding season, a male camel spider chases a female spider to mate with her. Once the mating has occurred, a female camel spider hunts for food, storing up as much fat in her body as she can. After an 11-day gestation period, she digs a burrow in the ground and lays from 50 to 250 eggs in it. A female camel spider stays in the burrow with her eggs until they hatch. She doesn\u2019t even leave the burrow to hunt for food, instead, she survives on stored fat. In some cases, if the female spider doesn\u2019t store up enough fat to live, she will die in the burrow before her eggs hatch. It takes three to four weeks for camel spider eggs to hatch. Once they do, the babies, also known as spiderlings, are able to hunt for small insects . As they grow larger, they can hunt for larger types of prey. As you can guess, the spiderlings of a camel spider are very small when they are born so they\u2019re vulnerable to a lot of predators. This is one of the reasons why a female has so many eggs. It improves the chances that at least some of the spiderlings will reach adulthood. A camel spider can live for up to one year. These animals are active only at night and hide well during the day. As a result, the population of camel spiders is unknown. However, they fall into the conservation category of least concern , according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) . Camel spiders are carnivores. They eat lizards , gerbils , beetles , small birds , snakes , and termites . The size of a camel spider ranges anywhere from three to six inches. But the biggest ones can get up to six inches long . These creatures got their name due to the myth that claimed these spiders ate the insides of a camel\u2019s stomach. This isn\u2019t true. A camel spider is too small to subdue a large mammal like a camel. But the name stuck with it even though the myth has been debunked. Camel spiders live in dry, hot climates. This includes places in the Middle East, Mexico, and the southwestern United States. Think of a desert or scrubland and you\u2019re picturing the habitat of a camel spider. Camel spiders can sometimes be dangerous to humans. If a person finds a camel spider and moves up close to it, the spider is likely to feel threatened and afraid. If the person tries to capture or touch the spider, there\u2019s a good chance the camel spider will bite the person. People who have been bitten by this spider have said that it\u2019s very painful. If you look at a close-up photo of a camel spider\u2019s jaws you will see why it would be painful! As a note, camel spiders don\u2019t have venom. Of course, the wound from this bite would have to be treated to avoid an infection. Like many other small animals, camel spiders would prefer to be left alone and not interact with humans. Unfortunately, there are many myths about them that have continued to circulate online. Some of the myths make camel spiders sound ferocious, but they are really very interesting creatures to read about. So, if you ever see one, it\u2019s best to move away and not try to harm or capture it. Fortunately, you can appreciate all of the amazing aspects of a camel spider without getting too close!",

        "Text": "The sea snake is incredibly venomous, even more than a cobra! There are over 60 species of sea snakes that belong to the same family as cobras , Elapidae . They are highly venomous and are divided into two groups. Firstly, true sea snakes belong to the Hydrophiinae subfamily. In addition, they are related to Australian terrestrial elapids. The second group is sea kraits, belonging to the subfamily Laticaudinae and closely related to Asian cobras. Sea snakes are venomous, and their toxins are very potent; however, if they do bite humans , fatalities are rare due to the small output of venom because their fangs are so short. There are 55 species of true sea snakes that typically measure between 3.2 to 5 feet in length, but there are individuals that can grow up to 8 feet. To adapt to their surroundings, sea snakes have flat bodies with short tails resembling an oar. In addition, they have valvular nostrils perched on top of their snouts and they have lungs that stretch through the entire length of their bodies. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . While there are around 70 different species of sea snakes, here are some of the most common ones: According to a recent study, there is no evidence regarding the specifics of when, where, and how often various species have developed their capacity to see colors, with sea snakes serving as an example: having entered the marine environment 15 million years ago, they have since been evolving in response to the ever-changing lighting conditions. The majority of modern-day sea snakes underwent evolution and diversification in this geographical area around 2 to 16 million years ago, during a period when the region was a sizable wetland network linked to Southeast Asia and the Australasian archipelago. Furthermore, the Coral Triangle in Southeast Asia was where the earliest sea snakes began to undergo evolution, around 6 to 8 million years ago, though the majority of sea snake species only began evolving between 1 to 3 million years ago. Sea snakes are found in coastal areas in the Western Pacific and Indian oceans and span from the eastern regions of Africa to the Gulf of Panama . However, some species live in the open ocean on the western coasts of the Americas, like the yellow-bellied sea snake . But their preferred habitat is shallow water, not deeper than 100 feet (but they can go down to 300 feet) because they need to hunt on the sea bed among coral reefs . In addition, certain species prefer hunting on soft bottoms consisting of mud, and others prefer hard bottoms, like corals. Some countries where you can find sea snakes include: The family Elapidae or Elapids are venomous snakes with permanently erect fangs, which include the sea snake. Most of the species in this family will react to a threat by rearing upwards and spreading their neck flap. They prefer warmer temperatures and occur in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Elapids vary in size and are generally neurotoxic. There are around 360 species in this family and over 170 subspecies, which include: Cobras come in all sizes and colors; some are yellow, black, red, banded, or mottled. They are generally large snakes, with many measuring more than 6 feet. The biggest true cobra is called the forest cobra and grows 10 feet long. In addition, Ashe\u2019s spitting cobra is the largest spitting cobra, measuring 9 feet long. On the other hand, the smallest species is the Mozambique spitting cobra that reaches 4 feet long when fully grown. Lastly, the King cobra lives up to its name and is the longest of all venomous snakes measuring a whopping 18 feet long! Mambas occur in the rocky hills and savannas of eastern and southern Africa. They hold the title of Africa\u2019s longest venomous snake, which reaches 14 feet when fully grown. In addition, they are super fast and can travel 12.5 miles per hour. Tiger snakes derived their name because they have stripes resembling a tiger, but not all have a striped pattern. Being bitten by a tiger snake is very dangerous because they are one of the most venomous snakes on the planet, and its fangs measure between 0.14 to 0.20 inches. They are great swimmers and glide through the water with ease. When threatened, the tiger snake will stand at attention and flatten their heads, similar to a cobra. The Sea snakes\u2019 scientific name is Hydrophiinae , and they belong to the family Elapidae . In addition, sea snakes fall under the class Reptilia . Most sea snakes fall into this category, but they are not the only ones. It also includes many species of venomous snakes like: Because there are so many species of sea snakes, it\u2019s hard to estimate their population size and conservation status under one umbrella. However, there are several species of sea snake on IUCN\u2019s Redlist listed as Endangered. For example, the Dusky sea snake shows up as Endangered, while the Crocker\u2019s sea snake is listed as Vulnerable. Sadly, two species are listed as Critically Endangered: the Short-nosed and Leaf-scaled sea snake. Sea snakes come in various sizes and colors. However, most of them measure between 4 to 5 feet long and usually have distinct ring patterns. Similar to most snakes, they are long and slender, but their tails are unique because they are flat, and the tip of the tail resembles a paddle, which helps with swimming. Sea snakes are typically ovoviviparous, except for a single genus, the Sea Krait , which is oviparous , and includes 5 species that lay their eggs on land. Ovoviviparous is when the eggs are kept in the uterus until they hatch. The females give birth to live young, who are generally quite large (sometimes half the length of the mother). Generally speaking, sea snakes can live for about ten years. The sea snake is incredibly venomous, even more than a cobra! Their venom is a deadly combination of myotoxins and neurotoxins. Luckily, there haven\u2019t been many recorded sea snake bites, and those that did get bitten all lived. Sea snakes rarely deliver venom when attacking due to their small fangs. Sometimes the bite is painless, and no symptoms occur. However, a few small teeth can remain behind in the wound. But, when symptoms appear, it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. They can include: Eventually, muscle degradation and paralysis kick in, and it can be fatal if the poison starts to affect the muscles involved in swallowing and respiration. Unfortunately, antivenom is almost impossible to find because sea snake bites are few and far between. Sea snakes are very timid creatures and would rather retreat in the face of danger. They are completely opposite from the cobra\u2019s aggressive nature, even though they belong to the same family. Humans eat sea snakes, and they are often exploited for their meat, organs, and skin. Unfortunately, CITES has yet to protect sea snakes even though they are often taken in great numbers. The Philippines was one of the biggest culprits because the sea snake\u2019s meat has been used commercially since 1934. Eventually, it was necessary to implement local protection to avoid over-exploitation. Other countries to exploit sea snakes are: Australia has since implemented special licenses to fish for sea snakes; however, there are many areas where they occur that are not controlled by governments and can not be monitored around the clock. But their biggest threat is climate change, low reproduction rates, and bycatch, and these factors are killing their population numbers. They have many predators and always need to be on the lookout, both from above and below. These predators include:",

        "Text": "The term gnat generally refers to a group of small flies that bite and annoy humans (although it can also include some non-biting insects as well). It\u2019s difficult to give a precise scientific definition of a gnat because it\u2019s more of a loose casual term rather than a taxonomical one. They don\u2019t all fit neatly into a single genus or family. With that said, there are a few things that unite all of them together. This article will cover some interesting facts about the habitat, diet, life cycle , and appearance of this small insect. As mentioned in the introduction, the gnat isn\u2019t a taxonomical classification but rather a very loose informal group. There are multiple families that people generally refer to as gnats, including the wood gnats (Anisopodidae) and the fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae and Keroplatidae). Some scientists also include black flies and midges in the definition as well. All of these families belong to the sub-order of Nematocera. A sub-order is a classification below order but above family. Mosquitoes and crane flies are also part of the same sub-order but not considered to be gnats. They are all part of the fly order Diptera. Gnats are generally small, long-legged insects with single pairs of wings. Featuring a small head, bulbous thorax, and long abdomen, normally with black or brown colors, their bodies tend to be quite slender compared to a standard fly, almost like a mosquito. Most species measure no more than an inch long, and some are only a fraction of an inch. Biting species have tough mouthparts to pierce the skin, while non-biting species have softer mouthparts. In contrast to the adult form, the larva has a long worm-like body and no wings at all. Fruit flies are small-bodied members of the fly order that feed on decomposing fruits and vegetables. They tend to breed quite prolifically in meat, spilled soda, or alcohol. They look much more like a typical house fly than anything else. While some websites list them as a type of gnat, this is probably not quite right, because they are part of different groups. Nevertheless, both can be annoying pests in the home. Of course, neither fruit flies or gnats live that long . These insects are found in just about every ecosystem around the world except for the extreme north and south. They tend to live near water or wet soil, although some do not. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Depending on whether they\u2019re biting or non-biting gnats, they can feed on a wide variety of different foods. Many species are either herbivores or omnivores. Gnats are preyed upon by all kinds of different animals, including frogs , reptiles , small mammals , birds , fish , spiders, and other insects . They have few defenses against predators except for their flying ability, but they are not often strong flyers. Most gnats generally feed upon plant material, including fruits, stems, and leaves, as well as other small bits of organic matter and even sometimes meat, but some species or groups are specialized for specific types of foods. Fungus gnats consume mushrooms and other fungi. Eye gnats, while generally harmless, are attracted to the fluids secreted by the eye. Biting gnats will generally draw blood from animals, giving them enough nutrients to create eggs, but otherwise, they feed on plants too when not tending to the young. There are all sorts of interesting facts about their feeding behavior. Depending on the species, gnats are generally considered to be an annoyance to people. Some of them bite the skin and draw blood; others will consume crops or lay their eggs near plants. Gnats are also generally attracted to moisture and organic matter, so if you\u2019re not careful, they can easily get into the garbage or the home. At their worst, biting gnats can transmit parasites and diseases to people. While some species are benign, an infestation is something you should generally take seriously. In order to get rid of them, there are a few steps you should take. You will need to eliminate or reduce sources of standing water around your yard and home. Dispose of any rotting or decomposing food immediately and keep the trash bin away from the home. Repair any holes in your door or window to prevent them from entering. Some gnats are also attracted to light in the evening, so keep the lights off to prevent them from gathering around your home. Finally, you should regularly clean bathrooms, kitchens, and other areas with lots of moisture. If gnats still persist in your home or property, then you might want to consider using some kind of pesticide or spray to control populations. All of these strategies may need to be pursued simultaneously to ensure maximum prevention.",

        "Text": "Kissing bugs are members of the Reduviidae family, and they originate from Central America. However, presently, they occur on every continent except Antarctica. This family includes a massive group of closely related insects, around 7000 species. Every species in this family share a characteristic: its sharp-tipped, curvy mouth, referred to as a three-segmented beak. This unique beak helps these insects kill their prey. These bugs are ambush predators, so they lay in waiting until prey comes close, and then they entrap them using strategic planning and tactics. Kissing bugs vary in color; for example, some are bright, and others possess showy accents. But, generally, they are brown, red, orange, green, or black in color. The kissing bug has many names, including chinches, barbeiros, pitos, vinchucas, and chipos. There are around 130 species within the subfamily that feed on vertebrate blood. However, there are very few species that drink blood from invertebrates . To make their lives easier, kissing bugs share shelter with nesting vertebrates while they suck on their blood like the little parasites they are. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The scientific name for kissing bugs differs depending on the specie. There are 11 species of these insects in the USA; they include: These bugs belong to the order Hemiptera , and they fall under the category of True bugs. This order is incredibly large and diverse; they are found across the globe and can adapt to almost any habitat. For example, there are approximately 80,000 species and 37 families in Hemiptera, which is divided into three subfamilies, namely, semiaquatic or shore-inhabiting bugs (Amphibicorizae), terrestrial bugs ( Geocorizae), and aquatic bugs (Hydrocorizae). This family greatly impacts agriculture and can cause irreparable damage to plants by passing on diseases and herbivory. However, farmers also use predatory Hemiptera species to control other pests in agricultural systems. There are approximately 149 species of kissing bugs, and they each have their own characteristics and come in various colors; however, generally, they are brown or black. Their mouthparts are covered in short hairs that grow longer on the tips. In addition, they have pronotum uniformly, a prominent plate-like shield covering some or all of the thorax, which is light brown or black. The tips of the kissing bug\u2019s scutellum, legs, and stout are all short and broad. And finally, these bugs are usually around an inch long. While these bugs occur globally, they are abundant in North and Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, and parts of Asia. In fact, there are 11 different species in the USA alone. These bugs are adaptable and can live in almost any habitat, but they are generally found in rainforests , nests, gardens, foliage, and homes. Kissing bugs do not live up to their name as they are not gentle, loving insects. Instead, these bugs are voracious pests and prey on animals like caterpillars , leafhoppers, and many other medium-sized insects. In addition, they suck the blood of vertebrates. But they also fall prey to: However, kissing bugs have a great defense mechanism called a stridulatory organ, which vibrates when they are in distress, which seems to deter predators. In addition, they use their sharp beaks to pierce the threat, injecting them with poison. When hunting, the kissing bug injects its prey with its poisonous saliva, causing the victim\u2019s internal organs to liquefy, which they proceed to suck out of the body. In addition, some species have tiny hairs on their legs, preventing prey from escaping. These blood-sucking insects are nocturnal because it\u2019s easier to prey on victims who are sleeping. Other behavioral traits include: Kissing bugs will lay their eggs in late summer or early fall. Adults will disperse at night and find rodent burrows or dens to lay their eggs. Nymphs hatch after 3 to 5 weeks and have to pass through 5 stages before maturing in adults. Each stage requires the nymphs to indulge in a full-blood meal before developing into the next stage. They can drink their fill quite quickly, with feeding lasting around 10 to 30 minutes. These bugs can consume 1 to 5 times their bodies\u2019 weight in blood and need to feed every 7 to 14 days in warm temperatures when hosts are available. Kissing bugs have a lifespan of around 1 to 2 years, spending their winters as nymphs and eventually morphing into adults by the summer. Females can produce 10-30 eggs between meals, and these bugs can lay up to 1000 eggs in a lifetime; however, the average number is closer to 200. While adults can fly, immature kissing bugs must crawl to find blood sources. The kissing bug is one of the main carriers of a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, and when a host is infected, it causes Chagas disease. Other animals like skunks and raccoons also carry this parasite; however, they cannot transmit it to humans, but the kissing bug can. However, these bugs can\u2019t infect their hosts with this parasite by just biting them. This disease has two phases; most people only experience the acute phase, which occurs right after transmission. The symptoms for this stage include aches, fever, swelling around the bite, and fever. But one of the most identifiable symptoms of this phase is puffy eyelids. Kissing bugs derive their name from the location they prefer to bite, which is usually close to the lips of the host. They usually defecate while feeding and can only transmit the parasite if their feces infect the bite site or are accidentally rubbed into a mucus membrane, like the eyes. So, if you feel a bite, try not to rub it, as you could land up infecting yourself! Most people go into remission after this phase, and the disease will not return. But 1/3 of patients experience the second stage, called the chronic phase. If patients do not seek help, it could affect their lives for years to come. Symptoms include: Unfortunately, Chagas disease is not well known in the USA, and very few patients are diagnosed or treated for this disease. However, doctors will usually prescribe antiparasitic drugs like Lampit (nifurtimox) and benznidazole if someone is diagnosed with this condition. These medications will kill the parasites and prevent the development of the chronic phase, which is untreatable. So it\u2019s essential to catch this disease early to prevent this from happening. Doctors will sometimes prescribe antiparasitics to people in the chronic phase, but this medication will never cure them. However, it could slow the illness\u2019s progression and help prevent life-threatening health conditions. Never touch kissing beetles; if you need to pick one up for some crazy reason, use gloves. It\u2019s good to know the difference between an innocent insect in your home and garden and a blood-sucking bug that can infect you with a dangerous parasite. Unfortunately, there are several insects that look almost identical to the kissing bug; they include: The leaf-footed bug has several body shapes, but some resemble the kissing bug\u2019s oval-like body, and others have long, slender bodies. However, their coloring is similar. They camouflage into the tree bark with their gray-brown color. In addition, they have elongated mouthpieces that closely resemble the kissing bug. They use this long mouthpiece to prick flowers or fruits and suck out the juices. Unlike the kissing bug, leaf-footed bugs are herbivores and eat tree sap. This is ideal as they can remain undetected as they feed. In addition, these insects are attracted to squash, and they are often referred to as the squash bug in certain regions of North America. Leaf-footed bugs are a potential threat to tomato crops, but preventative measures have proven successful. Farmers have mastered the art of getting rid of these bugs by getting spots where they like to overwinter. Stink bugs are also known by the name shield bugs because their shape looks like a shield. There are various types that are distinguished by their coloring, which ranges from different shades of green and brown. However, the feature that mostly resembles the kissing bug is their elongated mouthparts, which they use to suck juices from fruit and flowers. Stink bugs originated in North America, but today, they inhabit most of the world. They are different from kissing bugs as they are omnivores, and while they do eat smaller insects, stink bugs don\u2019t need to drink blood to survive. Stink bugs are unwelcome guests in most gardens because when they feed on a plant or flower, it causes discoloration. Plant bugs are members of the Miridae family, which forms part of the genus Heteroptera. Another name for these fascinating insects is the leaf bug. These bugs have elongated, oval-shaped bodies that closely resemble the kissing bug but have different coloring. Their bodies are covered in yellow, white, brown, or black patterns, which is the complete opposite of the primarily black kissing bug. Another difference between these two insects is their antennas. Kissing bugs have a six-segmented antenna, while plant bugs have a four-segmented antenna. In addition, plant bugs have round-shaped heads, but the kissing bug\u2019s head is elongated, which is a great way to distinguish between the two. However, to the untrained eye, it\u2019s tough to tell them apart, and it doesn\u2019t help that these two insects occur in the same habitat in certain regions of the globe. In fact, there are over 2,000 species of plant bugs distributed across North America.",

        "Fun_Fact": "The firefly produces some of the most efficient light in the world",
        "Text": "\u201c The firefly is a family of light-emitting insects . They produce light through a chemical reaction of oxygen, calcium, energy, and a light-emitting molecule called luciferin . \u201c Fireflies are some of the most popular and beloved insects in the world. Basically, all firefly larvae can produce light, but many species lose this ability in adulthood. Only a small number of firefly species light up the night sky with their bioluminescent ability. Bioluminescence means they can produce their light via a chemical reaction. Nearly all of the energy in this reaction is transformed into light, which makes fireflies one of the most efficient sources of light in the world. This article will cover some interesting facts about the habitat, diet, lifespan, and appearance of these glowing insects. The scientific name for the firefly family is Lampyridae . The name is derived from the Latin term lampyris, which roughly translates to mean glowworm (even though glowworm refers exclusively to a firefly larva or wingless adult). There are many different types of fireflies, encompassing some 2,000 documented species. About 150 of them live in the United States and Canada alone. Here are some of the most common subspecies: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Fireflies, an ancient group of insects, trace their origins back over 100 million years to a common ancestor of the two main lineages. However, fireflies are not the sole luminous insects in nature. There are also certain click beetles that possess the fascinating ability of bioluminescence, emitting light in a similar manner to fireflies. Based on our research findings, we suggest that during the mid-Cretaceous forest, the common ancestor of fireflies underwent an evolutionary process. This process involved the trade-off of its original function, which was most likely an aposematic warning display against nocturnal predation. As a result of this trade-off, the fireflies developed green light luciferase as a new adaptation. The firefly is a type of soft-bodied beetle that generally ranges widely in size and appearance. Most species are characterized by long, cylindrical bodies, often sporting black or brown colors with yellow or red markings. They have a pair of wings hidden beneath the hard shell cover, but in some species, the female is completely flightless and resembles the larval form. One such flightless female holds the record for the largest type of firefly in the world. It can easily reach the size of a human palm. However, most species are no more than one or two centimeters long. Fireflies create light for all kinds of different reasons: some are looking for mates, others are attempting to lure in prey, and yet others just want to warn away predators. The reasons can change depending on species and life stages. The cold light (which produces very little heat) is normally emitted from an organ near the end of the abdomen. Colors can come in yellow, orange, or green, and each species generally has its unique flashing pattern, which can be synchronized to communicate in groups. One of the most interesting facts is that many species lose their bioluminescence as an adult; they are active during the day and use chemical pheromones instead of light to communicate with potential mates. Before the firefly insect transforms into an adult, it passes through a few different life stages. The larva is the most common and longest-living of these stages. It has a long, segmented body, simple eyes, and no wings. The upper segments look a bit like overlapping plates; they are long and flat, extending over the sides of the bug. When it\u2019s ready to transform, the larva forms a large cocoon that encases the entire body. Lightning bugs are present all over the world except for the most extreme environments. They can be found most often populating forests, fields, meadows, and grasslands . Adults are most active in the summer months and spend the winter in a state of reduced activity. Many firefly insects come out at night, but non-glowing species are active during the day. Firefly populations are very healthy and widespread all over the globe. However, there is some evidence to suggest that firefly populations are on the decline. The cause might be related to light pollution, habitat loss, and pesticide use. Once an area has been cleared of its natural habitat, that firefly population may be gone for good. It does not simply move to a new area. The firefly does most of its feeding as a larva. When it transforms into an adult, its feeding patterns completely change. However, there are some facts about the firefly\u2019s feeding behavior we still don\u2019t understand. For a complete analysis of what fireflies eat, make sure to read our comprehensive guide \u2018 What Do Fireflies Eat? \u2018 Fireflies are preyed upon by numerous other insects, reptiles , birds , and small mammals . However, most firefly species leave a very bad taste in the mouth. Some can even cause temporary sickness when consumed. This will usually dissuade most predators from attacking them. Firefly larvae are completely carnivorous. They feed on snails , worms , and other insects. Some of them can inject a digestive substance directly into the prey that liquefies their organs. By the time they reach adulthood, they switch to an herbivorous lifestyle, feeding on the nectar and pollen; they may even help fertilize plants by spreading pollen from one flower to another. However, there are notable exceptions. A few types of so-called \u201cfemme fatale fireflies\u201d mimic the signaling pattern of another firefly species in an attempt to lure the male and then consume him. Some adult fireflies do not eat at all before they die. Fireflies do not generally cause harm to anyone; it\u2019s best to just leave them alone. However, if the fireflies are bothering you in some manner, then you should remove them from your property in an ethical manner by capturing and then releasing them. Sprays or insecticides should never be used.",

        "Text": "Hamsters are small-sized rodents. They are very commonly kept as house pets. However, unlike other rodents, they have short tails. Their legs are stubby with widely-spaced feet, and their ears are small. Hamsters are found in a variety of colors, using grey, yellow, black, white, brown, golden, and red. They exist in a mixture of several colors. They are usually 2 to 6 inches long and weigh about 6.2 oz on average. See all of our expert product reviews . There are several types of hamsters, including dwarf hamsters, golden dwarfs, and Syrian hamsters, which are also known as the teddy bear hamster . They go by the scientific name Cricetinae. Hamsters go by the scientific name Cricetinae. They belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata, and the class is Mammalia. The hamsters belong to order Rodentia and suborder Myomorpha. The family is Cricetidae, and the subfamily is Cricetinae. The lower classification of the hamsters includes the subphylum, which is Vertebrata. Meanwhile, the superfamily is Murodiea. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The name Cricetinae can be broken down into two words \u2013 cricetus and -inae (a suffix). Cricetus is rooted in New Latin, though it may come from the Czech word \u201ck\u0159e\u010dek.\u201d See all of our expert product reviews . The Syrian hamster was first described in 1839, but it wasn\u2019t until 1939 that researchers were able to successfully domesticate them. The entire population of Syrian hamsters is believed to be descendants of a single brother-sister pair captured from Aleppo, Syria, in 1930. After being imported to Jerusalem, they bred very successfully. Later, some animals from this original breeding colony were exported to the United States, where they quickly became popular as pets and laboratory animals. Comparative studies between wild and domesticated Syrian hamsters have revealed reduced genetic variability within the domestic strain. However, any differences found remain relatively small when compared with other variations seen in other lab animals. Hamsters are small rodents that have stout bodies. Their legs are stubby and stocky legs, and their ears are small. Hamsters have short tails that are even shorter than the length of their bodies. Their ears are furry, and their feet are wide. Though most species have fairly similar bodies, each one has identifying markings and sizes that determine which species they are. The dwarf hamster, much like their name, is a very tiny rodent. They are about 2 to 4 inches long. On the other hand, the Syrian hamster is quite different. It is also referred to as a teddy bear hamster or golden hamster, growing to approximately 6 inches long as an adult. On average, a hamster weighs about 6.2 ounces, making it rather small with very little muscle. In general, hamsters have thick and silky fur, and it could be long or short, depending on the hamster. This fur comes in a variety of colors, including black, grey, yellow, red, brown, and white. Some hamsters also have fur that is a blend of several different colors, but the combination will be determined by the breed. These rodents have a scent gland that is located in the middle of their bodies. In the case of a dwarf hamster, the scent gland is located in the hamster\u2019s stomach, allowing them to mark their territory. However, the Syrian hamster (aka the teddy bear hamster) has scent glands on their hips instead. Interestingly, hamsters have a natural way to get out of trouble when they need to escape \u2013 their skeletons. The flexibility of their rib cage allows them to flatten their body under small crevices. Anyone that owns such a pet will need to have a secure cage to keep them from escaping. Most wild hamsters are active during dusk time and night and need plenty of space to play at night time. Some of them can easily run up to 5 miles during this time. When hamsters are kept as pets, they maintain this natural routine. Their waking hours take up the nighttime, whether in the wild or in captivity, which means that they are awake during the night. They prefer to be undisturbed, so wild hamsters will avoid other wildlife and people during this time. Any unwarranted disturbance in their sleep could very well lead to a bite from these tiny rodents. They survive best in rooms where the lights are not kept on till very late. In the wild, many hamsters dig burrows, and several others are solitary creatures, which is why they need plenty of areas to conceal themselves. Wild hamsters hibernate during the cold weather months. These rodents get up during their hibernation periods only to eat occasionally. A loner hamster, it is said, should never be put in a cage with other hamsters as it can bite and harm it and, in some cases, even kill it. The only time that these animals are especially friendly towards other hamsters is when they are young (i.e., under three months old). They will even eat their young if they so desire. The dwarf hamster is an exception. They are surprisingly social, and they enjoy having multiple friends around in their family. In captivity, hamsters can sometimes flinch, grimace, and raises its hand toward their owners. This simple motion is an indication that the hamster may be ready to attack, showing exactly how they feel about the person infiltrating their safe space. If a human earns the trust of a hamster as a pet, the animal will gently move towards their hand and even crawl into it. They are fairly expressive animals, and there is no doubt about how they feel about their owner or surrounding animals. The first of these small rodents was found in Syria . However, they are also found in Belgium , northern China , Romania , and Greece . In the wild, hamsters prefer living in warm and dry areas. They like living in steppes, edges of deserts , and sand dunes. Hamsters have also become an incredibly popular pet, and there are many toys and hideaways that can be added to their home to recreate their natural surroundings. The primary diet of Hamsters includes seeds, nuts, grains, fruits, vegetables, and cracked corn. Apart from that, hamsters also eat small insects, lizards , as well as other small animals. Interestingly, hamsters have pouches on the inside of their cheeks, and they carry food in these pouches to store and eat later. Hamsters are known to defend themselves against these predators by using their incisors which are large in size. The mother hamsters also carry their children to safety by putting them in the pouches in their mouths. The predators of this small animal are numerous since they are small and easy to pick up. However, they are quite fast and spritely. The common predators of hamsters include snakes , birds, and other predatory mammals. That doesn\u2019t mean that a hamster won\u2019t put up a good fight. Instead, they use their naturally long incisors to bite. If the hamster is a new mother, she will keep her young safe within her mouth\u2019s pouches. Interestingly, the most likely cause of death in hamsters isn\u2019t being hunted \u2013 it is heart disease. Hamsters, in turn, feed on seeds, grains, fruits, nuts, cracked corn, small insects, lizards , and other animals. They are herbivores, so they do not seek out any other animal as prey. These animals should never eat kidney beans, tomato leaves, or unwashed produce. All of these sources of nutrients are incredibly toxic. Both male and female hamsters are known to be fast maters. They are known to waste no time in the process of reproduction, and it is often said that if hamsters from two separate genders are locked in a cage, the female can very quickly conceive. The gestation period in hamsters is about 15 to 20 days. A group of hamster babies, known as a litter, is born shortly after. The average litter size is six to eight pups. The hamster babies are blind till about two weeks after their birth. They have to be weaned when they are about three to four weeks old. However, these animals should be watched carefully, as they are one of many animals that may eat their young. It is said that female hamsters give birth to two to three litters of hamster babies annually. The lifespan of these small rodents is about one to two years. In captivity, they can survive up to three years. When comparing a hamster vs. a mouse , hamsters are generally larger than mice. In addition, hamsters generally are found in a wider variety of colors than mice. Mice are also more opportunistic eaters, while hamsters are known to hoard food and even store it in their mouths. Another popular pet rodent that hamsters are often compared with is guinea pigs . Guinea pigs are generally larger than hamsters and weigh several pounds, whereas hamsters weigh less than a pound. In addition, hamsters are omnivores, while guinea pigs are strict herbivores. While it is not known how many hamsters live in the wild all over the world, it has been said that the pet population of hamsters is around 57 million. About 11 million households have hamsters as pets . Little is known about hamsters living in zoos. However, it is said that they multiply quickly and find their way into parks, universities, and zoos. For anyone that wants to learn more about hamsters in an up-close way, most pet stores will carry at least a few different species. The subfamily Cricetinae contains 19 different species of hamsters from different geographical regions. Of these hamsters, many are never kept as pets. The five most commonly-kept types of hamsters for pet owners are Syrian hamsters, Campell\u2019s dwarf hamsters, Roborovski dwarf hamsters, winter white dwarf hamsters, and Chinese hamsters.",

        "Text": "Known for their distinctive radial-style webs, garden spiders are a common sight throughout much of Europe and North America . They live in various habitats, although you can usually find their large webs in and around gardens, hence their name. Despite their imposing size, they are not overly aggressive or dangerous to humans. In fact, many people consider them beneficial because they often prey on pests. The term garden spider can refer to many different species of spider in the family Araneidae, or orb weaver spiders. The family includes over 3,067 species in 177 genera, making it the third-largest spider family in the world. That said, when people talk about garden spiders, they are usually referring to the common garden spider, also known as the European garden spider, Araneus diadematus. In addition to simply the garden spider, it goes by several other names, including the diadem spider, cross spider, crowned orb weaver, and pumpkin spider. Its scientific name derives from the Greek and Latin words diadema, meaning \u201ccrown,\u201d and atus, meaning \u201clike.\u201d While most people mean Araneus diadematus when they refer to garden spiders, numerous other spiders have similar names. They include: Garden spiders display sexual dimorphism, with females measuring larger than males. Females range in length between 6.5 and 20 millimeters, while males vary from 5.5 to 13 millimeters long. Depending on the specimen, they come in a range of colors, including dark gray, light yellow, orangish-red, and dark brown. That said, all garden spiders feature characteristic white markings across the dorsal side of the abdomen. These markings form the shape of a cross similar to a fleur de lis, hence the reason behind one of its common names, the cross spider. The abdomen appears quite bulbous and sports a covering of tiny hairs. Meanwhile, longer hairs cover the cephalothorax. Like all spiders, they possess eight legs, four to each side, which are covered in spiky hairs. Originally hailing from Europe, you can now find garden spiders throughout North America. They typically live in grasslands , parks, and gardens, hence their name. They require access to moisture and plenty of sites that they can use to attach their webs. Common sites for their webs include trees, bushes, shrubs, and flowers. However, they will also readily make use of human structures such as doorways, windows, or posts. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Garden spiders construct distinctive radial-style webs perpendicular to the ground. The first web they construct almost always looks nearly perfect but doesn\u2019t remain so for long. At the end of each day, they deconstruct, roll up, and consume the silk so they can recycle the protein and make new silk. The average web contains between 25 and 30 radial threads consisting of regular angles between 12 and 15 degrees. Typically, the webs of younger spiders feature more radii than the webs of older spiders. At their largest, garden spider webs can measure nearly 20 centimeters in diameter. Like all spiders, garden spiders are carnivores that prey on insects and other invertebrates. They prey primarily on flying insects that stumble into their webs, such as flies , moths , mosquitos , and beetles . In addition, females may cannibalize males either before or after mating. Garden spiders possess poor eyesight, so they must rely on other senses to hunt for food. To catch their prey, they wait near the edges of their webs or in a silken retreat. They monitor their web by holding onto a signal thread with one of the claws on their feet. If they sense any vibrations, they will rush forward to inject their unfortunate prey with paralyzing venom. This venom serves a dual purpose: it helps to sedate their meal and protect the spiders from potential injury. With their prey paralyzed, garden spiders then set about wrapping up their meal with silk. Depending on how much prey is readily available, they may consume their food immediately or save it for later. For the most part, garden spiders aren\u2019t something you want to worry about getting rid of. As their name implies, they mostly build their webs outdoors in gardens, parks, and fields. They rarely make their way inside homes, which reduces the need to remove them. In addition, many people consider them beneficial because they prey on garden pests. However, if you decide you want to get rid of garden spiders, there are a few things you can do. First, minimize places for them to hide or build their webs. Next, down any spider webs that you come across. Finally, if you\u2019re really serious, you use insecticides to kill off their food sources.",

        "Text": "Venom from one cone snail is enough to theoretically kill 700 people. The shells of the cone snail are so beautiful, alluring, and every shell collector\u2019s dream. However, these snails are one of the deadliest types of animals in the world. They are venomous and their sting can either be as harmless as a bee sting or fatal enough to kill over a dozen people. Cone snails are named after their intricately designed conical shells. They are a sizeable group of venomous, carnivorous, predatory gastropods that are found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. The cone snail is the common name of the members of the family Conidae . Conidae contains 16 genera. The exact number of cone snail species is uncertain, and most authors estimate there could be about 1,000 species. Until 2015, the known species of cone snails, around 600 at the time, were considered to be under one genus, Conus . Then, after some genetic experiments, modifications were made to the cone snail classification and three new genera were introduced: Conasprella, Californiconus, and Profundiconus. The hundreds of cone snail species were split into these four genera, with 85% of them being grouped under Conus . The cone snail is believed to have origins in the Indo-Pacific region. Cone snail fossils have been unearthed and date back to the Eocene Epoch which occurred about 56 million to 33.9 million years ago. Some of them also date back to the Holocene Epoch 12,000 to 11,500 years ago. The cone snail underwent many periods of diversification, and have the highest rate of diversification of any marine gastropod. Research suggests that three main ancestral lines appeared soon after the origin of the species. These three lineages continue today, with one lineage having living species that can be found in the Indo-Pacific, another with species in the East Pacific and West Atlantic, and the last occurring only in the East Pacific. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Cone snails have varying diets, with most of them being vermivorous ( worm feeders), and the rest molluscivorous (mollusk feeders), piscivorous ( fish eaters), or more than one. Their diet is believed to have evolved at least a few times at varying degrees depending on their location and habitat. The reputation of the cone snail\u2019s decorative beauty and terrifying speed of killing precedes it. Cone snail shells are coveted by shell collectors because of their otherworldly patterns and designs, as well as their perfectly geometric conical shape. Empty cone snail shells often find their way to sandy beaches where people pick them up as keepsakes. Cone snails come in all sorts of colors like pink, white, blue, cream, brown, yellow, and some may be multicolored or come in just one solid color. All cone snail shells have whorls which are a full turn of the shell. They also have spires which are the whorls that are located on the wider end of the shell above the main shell whorl. The opening of the shell is long, just like the conch\u2019s, and they have a small operculum. Cone snail shells can be smooth, rough, or even bumpy depending on the species. These snails come in small, medium, and large sizes and measure from half an inch to nine inches long. They have a muscular foot which is used for movement as well as subduing prey. Cone snails also have a well-developed siphon which they use to sample their environment for prey while buried in the sand, as well as for respiration, and sucking in water for movement. The snail\u2019s feet and siphon may also come in colorful patterns. Cone snails have radular teeth whose appearance and number depends on the species. The teeth are usually serrated and is usually likened to a harpoon. They have two tentacles on their head and each of these contains an eye . The snails have gills between the mantle and their body. All cone snails are venomous and the extent of the fatality of their venom depends on their sizes and species. Usually, the larger the size, the more fatal the venom. Venom from smaller cone snails are not usually dangerous to humans, but the larger snails can do some serious permanent damage. The cone snail \u201cstings\u201d its prey with a needle-like radula tooth which triggers the release of venom from their venom gland into the prey. This venom works by paralyzing the prey, allowing the snail to engulf it. The venom from one cone snail is believed to be able to kill an estimated 700 people. Only two species of cone snails have caused human deaths from their bites: the geography snail ( Conus geographus ), and the textile snail ( Conus textile ). Cone snails usually hunt at night when they are the most active, but some are known to be active during dusk and dawn, making them crepuscular and nocturnal animals. These snails like to burrow in sand to wait for their prey to move pass or they lure them with the use of their proboscis. Cone snails are very slow creatures so they rely on the speed of their radula to catch nimble prey. Even though cone snails are notorious for their ability to bring down bigger animals, and even human beings with just a sting, they are not aggressive in nature. Apart from their prey, they are known to only sting when they come in contact with humans, such as when they are stepped on, or picked up by divers. One sting contains enough venom to kill 15 people, and one snail can theoretically kill 700. It is safe to say, if you see a cone snail during your dive or in shallow water, swim in the opposite direction. Only 27 recorded deaths have been known to have resulted from cone snail venom, but the real number is higher. Cone snail sting symptoms include swelling, tingling in the stung area, numbness, localized pain, vomiting, muscle paralysis, blurred vision, respiratory paralysis, and, eventually, death. Depending on the severity of the sting, the effects can be felt immediately or after a few days. The deadliest cone snail, the geography snail, was jokingly given the nickname \u201ccigarette snail\u201d because a stung person would only have time to smoke one cigarette before dying. Treatment for a severe cone snail sting involves pain relief by using hot water on the affected area, pressure immobilization to prevent the spread of the venom, bandaging, and CPR. However, there is currently no available anti-venom because of the complexity of the toxins. Because of the fast-acting and accurate nature of the toxins, cone snail venom is used in the pharmaceutical industry to treat illnesses. It is used to make pain relievers, including one that is 1,000 times stronger than morphine which was developed from the venom of the magician cone snail, Conus magus . Cone snail venom is being tested for potential use to cure other diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and epilepsy. Cone snails are carnivorous animals that prey on other creatures. They eat marine worms, fish, mollusks, and other snails including cone snails. They can be arranged into three groups based on their dietary preferences: The feeding instruments of cone snails depend heavily on the snail\u2019s diet. The radula is specially adapted to cater to each type of cone snail. The vermivores have short and wide radula with barbs close to the middle of it. Their radula is serrated. Piscivores possess a longer radula equipped with a long, smooth shaft and long, curved barbs at the tip of the shaft. The radula of the molluscivore cone snails are serrated over most of the shaft length and the barbs are heavy close to the base. Cone snails usually hunt using two methods: the hook-and-line technique, and net-hunting. In the hook-and-line method, the cone snail lures its prey over by brandishing its proboscis. Once the prey gets close enough, the snail stings it swiftly, paralyzing it before swallowing it whole. In the net-hunting method, the cone snail actually swallows the prey before stinging it with its radula. The cone snail is able to swallow its prey whole by expanding its proboscis. Cone snails are tropical marine animals with a few exceptions. They can usually be found in warm, tropical zones such as the Great Barrier Reef , the Indian and Pacific Oceans , California , Southern Australia , Hawaii , and Baja California. Some cone snails are native to more semitropical zones like the Mediterranean, the Cape coast of South Africa , and southern California. Cone snails typically inhabit shallow water close to coral reefs, under coral shelves, or mangroves. They can be found underneath rocks in the intertidal and subtidal zones. Cone snails like to bury themselves in sand with their siphon sticking out from the surface to probe for prey. They are unlikely to be found in very deep waters. Their average range of depth is from sea level to 656 feet below sea level. Unlike many other types of snails, cone snails are believed to have distinct sexes. They are also monogamous and tend to live solitary lives until mating season comes around. The mating process usually last about 15 minutes and involves the male snail climbing on the female with his foot and fertilization takes place internally. Two to three days after copulation, the female lays about 1,000 to 5,000 egg capsules on a solid surface. The average number of eggs the female cone snail lays is around 2,500. Each of the capsules contain a different number of eggs. About twenty days later, the eggs hatch veliger larvae where they can swim freely until they reach adulthood. Only a small number of cone snails actually make it to adulthood which is why so many eggs need to be laid. Cone snails reach sexual maturity in 6 to 12 months. Not enough information is known about their life cycle, but they are estimated to live up to 10 to 20 years of age. Cone snails have a very well-developed radula tooth which acts as both an attack system to catch prey, and a defense system to protect itself. Because of this, they do not have many predators in their adult stage of life. Their natural predators as adults include hermit crabs , sea turtles , rays , horseshoe crabs , and larger predatory fish. Human beings are also considered a predator due to their collection of cone shells. Cone snails can put up a good fight by stinging their assailants though. In their hatchling stages as larvae, cone snails are predated on by nektonic fish and animals that feed via filler-feeding.",

        "Name": "False Killer Whale",
        "Genus": "Pseudorca",
        "Diet": "Carnivore that eats fish, squid, and marine mammals",
        "Behavior": "They usually live in pods.",
        "Features": "The versatile vocalizations",
        "Fun_Fact": "The false killer whale looks like a cross between a dolphin and orca!",
        "Text": "The false killer whale is a fast and agile swimmer, a peak predator, and a highly intelligent and social animal. The name obviously arises from the similarities between orcas and false killer whales. Until 1862, early taxonomists classified both species within the same genus. Despite the name, this species is sometimes mistaken for the bottle-nosed dolphin or short-finned pilot whale. It is now under threat in certain parts of its range. The scientific name of these animals is Pseudorca crassidens. Pseudorca obviously means pseudo (or false) orca, while crassidens means thick-toothed in Latin. The false killer whale is the only currently living member of its genus (although the fossil record shows there were two additional known species). It belongs to the family of Delphinidae, making it closely related to oceanic orcas and dolphins. Obviously, as a cetacean, this is a type of mammal to its core, because it gives birth to live young and produces milk. The cetaceans actually evolved from hoofed mammals some 50 million years ago. An early cetacean ancestor probably looked like the modern deer-like chevrotain, but the hippos are the closest living relative. A fossil of a false killer whale was first discovered in 1843 in a marine environment that was believed to have existed about 126,000 years ago. The false killer whale is in the family of oceanic dolphins and their closest living relatives are Risso\u2019s dolphins, the pilot whale, the melon-headed whale, and the pygmy killer whale. Thought to have been extinct, the whale earned its own genus in the late 1800s when it was found to be neither a killer whale nor a dolphin. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These animals actually look a bit like a cross between a dolphin (with its rather sleek, ergonomic body) and a killer whale (because of the rounded head with no beak). Nevertheless, you probably wouldn\u2019t mistake them for an orca. The false killer whale has a much smaller dorsal fin and a distinctly curved hump on the flippers. And instead of the black and white coloration of the orca, the false killer whale has a black or dark gray coloration with a streak of white along the side. This makes it look more like an oceanic dolphin. The male of this species measures up to 20 feet long and 3,000 or 4,000 pounds in weight, while the female measures a slightly less formidable 16 feet. This is around the size of a pickup truck. These animals have a truly massive territory that graces every continent except for Antarctica. Due to its preference for temperate and warm tropical waters, this species has a natural range that extends around the coasts of Africa , India, the Pacific Asia region (including Australia and New Zealand), the American Pacific Coast as far as Hawaii, the Caribbean Sea, and the Mediterranean. It has also been found as far north as the North Sea around Britain and Norway , China and Japan, Pacific Canada, and Alaska. They typically dive to around 2,000 feet in search of food, but as a mammal, they must come up occasionally for air. Exact population figures are unknown, but local populations in the low tens of thousands have been observed in certain regions such as China and Japan. Despite its wide range, this species is actually near threatened . The biggest threats to its survival are the depletion of prey, injury or death from net entanglements, and environmental pollution. Even though the United States has banned many harmful chemicals, pollution can still travel the world\u2019s currents from other regions. Since this species occupies the top of the food chain, it is exposed to toxins that accumulate at lower levels. Like many dolphins, these animals feed almost exclusively on squid, fish, and, to a smaller degree, marine mammals like sea lions and seals. Some of the more common prey include yellowtail, yellowfin tuna, perch, and salmon . The false killer whale will attack prey by catching them in its mouth as it swims around at high speeds. It will then shake its prey until they die and peel off the skin with its sharp teeth. The false killer whale has few natural predators in the wild apart from maybe sharks and other killer whales, but calves are mostly defenseless and much more prone to attack. They rely on the protection of their mother and the entire group. Humans do sometimes hunt false killer whales but not in particularly large numbers or on an industrial scale. Like many other cetaceans, the false killer whale has a rather complex reproductive cycle that involves long maturation and development times. The breeding season lasts all year long but seems to peak in later winter or early spring, during which time both males and females will have multiple mating partners. After copulation, the female undertakes a long and difficult pregnancy that lasts up to 16 months. It\u2019s no surprise then that she only produces a single calf at a time and does not conceive again for around seven years. The young calf emerges from the womb with the ability to swim on its own. However, it will stay with its mother for up to two years while it receives protection, tutelage, nutrients from the milk, and valuable survival skills. It takes around eight to 11 years for females to mature and eight to 10 years for males. This development time sets them up for a long and successful life, usually lasting around 60 years in the wild. Females begin to experience menopause between 44 and 55 years of age. The false killer whale is rarely hunted for food or other resources with a few notable exceptions. In some Japanese villages, people herd them with boats into a bay or on a beach to prevent their escape. People in the eastern tropical Pacific region may also consume their meat.",

        "Features": "Three-pronged antennae",
        "Fun_Fact": "The ancient Egyptians worshipped scarabs.",
        "Text": "Did you know that the ancient Egyptians revered a beetle that ate poop? There are many species of Scarab beetles, and these hard-shelled beetles are both diverse and interesting. Some are brown or black, while others have brilliant colors or a metallic sheen. They live in almost every part of the world and are some of the largest insects that we know. While most people think of one specific species, scarab beetles refer to an entire family of beetles, over 30,000 species total. Their scientific name is Scarabaeidae and they have at least 19 subfamilies. They belong to the order Coleoptera, which includes all beetles. Beetles are characterized by hard front wings called elytra. This order is the largest of the insect world and makes up over 25% of all known species on the earth. Some notable scarabs include the dung beetle , which is actually an informal name of different kinds of scarab beetles that roll dung as part of their behavior. Japanese beetles, Jewel scarabs, and Hercules beetles are all other examples of members of the Scarabaeidae family. The Scarabaeus sacer is a dung beetle that was worshipped in ancient Egypt and the beetle that most people associate with the scarab family. Scarabs are part of the Insecta class, Arthropoda phylum, and Animalia kingdom. Understanding where these diverse beetles fit into the animal kingdom is important because they make up such a big part of the insect world. Like all beetles, scarabs have hard front wings, which gives them a rotund appearance. They have antennae at the front of their bodies. They use these to sense odors in their environment. One of their most distinctive features is that their antennae end in a three-pointed club. They can ball these up or spread them out, depending on how they need to use them to smell. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Many also have horns near their antennae as well. While they are not large, scarabs do use these horns to battle each other. Their legs have scallops on the edges, which help with digging. This is another feature that many people associate with scarabs. With so many species, the sizes of scarabs vary as well. The smallest species are around 0.2 inches while the largest is over 4 inches long. The African Goliath Beetle, Goliathus giganteus , is one of the heaviest insects that is known in the animal kingdom. Some have brightly colored elytra, while others are brown and black to blend in with their environment. They can be quite large and distinctive, which makes them popular with bug collectors. The brighter varieties make great additions to your collection. Because there are so many different species, they have widely different habitats as well. Most like environments with manure or decomposing plants. As long as they have a food source, they can live in a wide variety of habitats. They exist on all continents other than Antarctica. These include North America , South America , Asia , Africa , Europe , and Australia . In some areas, they are natural inhabitants. Other areas have imported them. Still others have seen species of scarabs become invasive . Generally, scarab beetles prefer temperate environments because their food is plentiful. They also like gardens and cultivated plant environments, although they are not liked as much by gardeners. Some do live in arctic burrows, however. The diversity of habitats directly reflects the diversity of species. Many species of scarabs eat dung or dead and decomposing plants. Scarabs that are considered dung beetles often roll balls of dung that they later bring back to their homes. This is a notable behavior that led people to give them the name of dung beetle in the first place. Dung beetles eat the nutrients that are left over in dung after larger animals have eaten and digested their food. They can be quite discerning, with some species only eating dung from carnivores and others only eating dung from herbivores. The ancient Egyptians were fascinated with dung beetles and considered them a symbol of the cyclical nature of life on earth. Other species prefer live plants, such as leaves and vines. Fruit that has fallen to the forest floor and fungi are also popular foods with scarab beetles. They are relatively small and don\u2019t need a lot to eat. A few do go after small insects and larvae. Generally, most species of scarab beetles do not pose much of a threat. In fact, some parts of Australia actually brought dung beetles in to deal with the waste products on their farms. When introducing scarab beetles or any new animal to the environment, it is critical to take measures to keep their population in check. However, there are some species that can pose a problem for gardeners and farmers. European Chafers and Japanese Beetles are two species that are classified as invasive species. They have spread beyond their natural habitat, where the population is kept in check by natural predators and environmental conditions, to areas where they can reproduce without these natural controls. When they are larvae, scarabs can feed on roots causing damage. Some adult scarabs cause damage to leaves and fruits, inhibiting growth. Evidence of scarab infestations looks like most other garden issues, with plants failing to grow or showing yellow or brown leaves. For the worst infestations, the roots of plants and grasses will be weak. You might even be able to see the larvae feeding on roots when you pull up the weak plants. Adult scarabs are quite large and easy to see flying, which is more frequent at night. Insecticides that target adult and larvae forms are the most effective. Because these can be heavy chemicals, it\u2019s best to work with a professional treatment company to determine a safe and effective solution. You can also remove scarab larvae and adults as you find them, although this isn\u2019t as effective when you are dealing with a major infestation. Ladybug: Another beetle member of the Coleoptera order, ladybugs are the Coccinellidae family of beetles. June Bug: While often considered on its own, a June bug, or member of the Phyllophaga genus, is actually a type of scarab. They are called June bugs due to the time of year that they are most plentiful.",

        "Text": "Ten-lined June beetles are members of the Scarabaeidae family and fall into the class Insecta. They occur all over the globe and are known for their unique wings, which are covered in linear patterns. They also go by the name watermelon beetles and have very poor eyesight, which is why they are so attracted to lights. Unfortunately, their fascination for lights is their downfall because it makes them easier to catch in backlight cages and other gadgets. Ten-lined June beetles are native to the Northern Hemisphere, with dense populations in the United States and Canada. Their primary diet consists of tree roots; however, they also like to drink grapefruit and raspberry juice. These beetles are known as pests because they can cause the trees they feed on to decay. While the larvae can live for around 4 years, adults barely survive for more than 10 months. The ten-lined June beetle\u2019s scientific name is Polyphylla decemlineata, and the genus consists of 85 species, which include: The saline valley snow-front scarab ( Polyphylla anteronivea ) is also known as the saline valley snow-front June beetle, and they belong to the family Scarabaeidae. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This species is native to North America. Their ideal habitat is forests or orchards, and they are distinguished by their white elytra scales that form stripes down their bodies. Unfortunately, adults are drawn to lights, which often leads to death. Saline valley snow-front scarabs lay their eggs in the soil, usually close to plants where the larvae hatch and bore down into the roots, where they will live and feed for two to three years before morphing into pupae. Spotted Warner valley June beetles primarily occur in the Northern Hemisphere and mainly emerge during warm spring evenings; they, too, are attracted to lights. They vary in size from 0.5 to 1 inch, and have metallic wings (elytra) that cover most of their bodies. These beetles are nocturnal and feed on flowers and foliage, often causing extensive damage. Their larvae are called white grubs and measure around an inch in length, burrowing into the soil where they stay for years. In addition to damaging flowers, they also destroy: The Mount Hermon June beetle originated in Santa Cruz County, California, where it was first discovered in 1938. The males are petite with black heads and dark brown elytra, which are covered in long brown hair. In addition, they have stripes all over their bodies. These stripes are broken and usually resemble discontinuous clumps. The females are more prominent and also have black heads; however, the lower part of their faces are chestnut in color. In addition, their head, thorax, and legs are covered in golden hair. The difference in size between this species\u2019 sexes is quite significant, with females measuring 0.87 by 0.43 inches and males 0.79 by 0.39 inches. Ten-lined June beetles belong to the order Coleoptera and are best distinguished by their front pair of wings called elytra. This order is the largest of the Insecta class and contains around 400,000 species, with new specimens discovered often. They are members of the family Scarabaeidae , who are recognized for their stout bodies and metallic colors. Members vary in size and can measure between 0.059 to 6.2 inches. One of their distinguishing features is their clubbed antennae that compress into a ball or fawn out like leaves, which they use to sense odors. In addition, many species in this family are burrowers, and have legs adapted for digging. Some adult species have horns on their head, which they use to fight over resources or mates. The largest species ever found was fossilized, named Oryctoantiquus borealis , and it measured 2 inches long. The ten-lined June beetle is best recognized by the four white lines running down its elytra. In addition, they have antennas with lamellate plates. Their coloring differs depending on the sex, but they are generally black or reddish-brown in color. These beetles are usually between 0.8 to 1.5 inches long. However, the grubs can reach lengths of 2 inches if they receive proper nutrition. When compared to the Hercules beetle , they are nearly half the size! These beetles occur throughout the Northern and Western United States and Canada. However, large populations inhabit states like: They prefer to live in forests, shrublands, and farmlands and are considered agricultural pests because tin-lined June beetles\u2019 larvae live in the soil and feed on the roots of plants, destroying them in the process. The diet of ten-lined June beetles varies, but they primarily feed on plant-based food like The grubs are detrimental to plants because they cause decay when feeding on the roots. The life cycle of ten-lined June beetles is relatively long for an insect. These beetles can take up to two years to complete one generation. In fact, larvae can develop in soil for up to 4 years! The larvae inhabit the top soil (around 14 inches from the surface), where they feed on roots. Adult females will make their way to the surface every summer or early autumn and release pheromones to attract males. Around this time, males will fly around from dusk until midnight in search of a mate. Once the mating is over, the females burrow back into the soil to lay their eggs. While the larvae can live up to four years, there is no record of the lifespans of adults; however, it is thought that they die after laying eggs. Unfortunately, the only way to exterminate heavily infested areas is by removing the trees, and the surrounding soil needs to be fumigated to prevent the larvae from claiming nearby trees. In addition, commercial growers apply soil insecticides to kill the larvae as aboveground chemicals do not work. However, these methods only apply to large areas like forests. Home gardens are a different story. Female ten-lined beetles cannot fly, so populations spread slowly, making them easily manageable in a small space. Homeowners can use lights to attract these beetles and capture them with a net. Some people feed them to their chickens, while others squish them once caught.",

        "Text": "The Moon Jelly is a type of jellyfish found throughout warmer waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. These jellyfish prefer the coastal parts of the ocean such as harbors or inlets near the beach. They often wash up on the beach because they are not strong swimmers. Unlike many other species of jellyfish , their sting is not very painful because they only have a collection of very small tentacles. They are the most common type of jelly to be kept as a pet. They are also used in cuisine in parts of Asia, in both sweet and savory dishes. Moon Jellyfish are known as A. aurita . Aurelia means gold-colored puppa in Greek, while aurita in Latin means furnished with hears. They may also be called moon jellies, saucer jellies, or common jellyfish. They are classified as a type of plankton, primarily because of their low swimming abilities. They cannot swim against anything stronger than a weak current and are generally washed wherever the ocean takes them. There are currently 25 accepted species of Aurelia, with several others whose designation is pending. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The Kavli Institute researchers have found out that the moon jellyfish\u2019s metamorphosis was achieved without any major genetic mutations, but by utilizing a subset of pre-existing genes to transform from polyp to medusa, instead of the conventional process of mutation and natural selection. Moon jellyfish inhabit warm oceanic waters and are commonly found near coastlines in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, spanning across the globe. Jellyfish possess genetic adaptations that enable them to regulate their body\u2019s salt concentration at the molecular level, enabling them to move both vertically and horizontally to capture their prey, without being impacted by fluctuations in ocean salinity levels. Moon Jellyfish are primarily clear or transparent, with a single translucent disk in the center of their bell, which is usually blueish. Their bodies, also known as bells, are gelatinous orbs with many small tentacles. Because they are bioluminescent, they can be found glowing blue or pink in darker waters or as a means to communicate with other jellies. Moon jelly predators may confuse a plastic bag floating in the ocean for a jellyfish and eat that instead. Moon jellies may be up to 18 inches across at the bell. They are called \u201cmoon\u201d jellies because of their round, glowing bell and short tentacles. Moon Jellyfish can be found in shallower areas of most of the warmer oceans. These jellies prefer to live in waters between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but they don\u2019t mind water that is dirty or low in oxygen. Blooms of moon jellyfish are monitored by scientists because how they grow and shrink is an indicator of other things happening in the ocean around them. If moon jelly numbers swell, it means there is either an abundance of their prey or a dearth of their predators. These jellyfish can survive in oxygen-poor and even polluted waters that other sea creatures simply cannot. According to the IUCN Redlist of endangered species, these moon jellies are considered not endangered or threatened. Moon Jellyfish eat a lot of invertebrates, including other plankton, mollusk larvae, and crustaceans. They may also consume certain fish eggs and even tiny fish. Moon jellies use their tentacles to paralyze their prey and sweep them into their mucus membranes in order to ingest them. The biggest threats to moon jellies besides humans are sea turtles and sharks, but their populations are not at risk. Other predators include marine mammals, large fish, and certain sea birds. Moon Jellyfish lay eggs that are fertilized by sperm. This is done when a female moon jelly ingests floating sperm released by a male moon jelly and her body carries it to the eggs. Those moon jelly eggs float until they find a firm surface on which to attach, at which point they hatch and become planula, which then turns into polyps. These moon jelly polyps may wait for up to 25 years before becoming ephyra and then adults. As adults, they usually only live about a year, although sometimes, a moon jellyfish can be triggered into de-aging or aging backward to become younger. Many people say that jellyfish are technically immortal because of this ability to become babies and then grow up again because, in the absence of predators, the moon jellies could potentially do this de-aging and re-aging cycle indefinitely. Moon Jellyfish are often used in Chinese and Japanese cooking, as well as cuisines in other parts of Southeast Asia . They are not particularly flavorful, but they do add saltiness to dishes and can be used to create items such as glowing ice cream! Cooking with moon jellies became encouraged when jellyfish populations swelled and became a danger to fishing vessels. The jellies are not eaten fresh as they dissolve when taken from the water and killed. Instead, moon jellyfish are generally stripped of their mucus membranes and tentacles, then the moon jellies are sliced up and salt-cured.",

The Zorse is the result of cross-breeding a generally male Zebra (stallion) with a female Horse (mare) to produce an animal that looks more like a Horse than a Zebra but has stripes. Related: 12 Hybrid Animals That Are Actually Real The Zebra part also gives the Zorse resistance to certain pests and diseases that normally affect both Horses and Donkeys, meaning that they are not only sturdy but also very hardy animals. Due to the fact that there are not only three different sub-species of Zebra but also nearly 300 different breeds of domestic Horse, the Zorse can vary quite dramatically, particularly in size and color, depending on its parents. The Zorse is very Horse-like in appearance since it inherits its shape, size, color and temperament from its mother. One of the Zorse\u2019s most notable features is the dark stripes that are boldest on its legs and rear, along with also commonly being found on the rest of the body, neck and head. The Zorse is an animal that tends to have short, coarse fur that can range in color from tan to brown to black, with a darker mane and tail (although the exact characteristics of the Zorse are dependent on the breed of the female Horse). Zorses have a large head with a long muzzle, pricked-up ears and large, dark eyes with long eyelashes that help to stop things from getting into their eyes. Zorses have long, thin legs that are incredibly muscular and end in generally black (but sometimes white) colored hooves that are made from horn and allow the Zorse to be more sturdy when moving through various different terrains. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Unlike the case with the Zonkey where there have been a number of wild Zonkey sightings reported, it is almost impossible for a fully wild Zorse to occur without human intervention of some kind. There are three different sub-species of Zebra that are found in eastern and southern Africa on the vast open grasslands and savannah, but the incredibly rare wild horse is historically native to parts of Europe and Asia meaning that the two species would not come together naturally in the wild. In parts of Africa though where human settlements are either close to or intrude on the Zebra\u2019s natural habitat, it is possible for a semi-wild Zorse to occur with the mating of a wild Zebra with a domestic horse . Nearly all of the world\u2019s Zorses however, are found either in zoos or animal institutes around the world, with a number also being used as work horses particularly in parts of North America. In the wild, both Zebras and Horses roam throughout their natural environment in herds that can contain anywhere from two to more than two hundred individuals, making Zorses relatively sociable animals that prefer to live with other equines. Their temperaments however, are generally similar to those of their mother, including their strong flight response which is heightened by their Zebra side. Zorses are strong and muscular animals that spend the majority of their lives grazing, and along with the fact that theyhave better night vision than people, they are known to have almost 360 degree vision with the exception of a blind spot in front of their nose and directly behind them. The Zorse\u2019s large, pricked ears give it incredible hearing, and their large nostrils mean that they also have a keen sense of smell. Zorses are animals that are produced when a male Zebra mates with a female Horse. After a gestation period that usually lasts for around 11 months, the female Horse gives birth to a single Zorse foal. Like the offspring of numerous other hoofed-herbivores, the Zorse is able stand up within an hour after birth and begins to canter a few hours after that. Although they are much smaller in size than their parents, the Zorse is born with incredibly long legs that are actually nearly their adult length already. As with other hybrid animals, including both Zonkeys and Mules, Zorses are sterile, meaning that although they still display normal breeding behavior, they are unable to produce offspring of their own. Zorses tend to be very healthy and hardy animals that can live to be more than 30 years old. Like other equines including both Zebras and Horses, the Zorse is a herbivorous animal meaning that it only consumes plants and plant matter in order to gain all of the nutrients that it needs to survive. They spend almost all of their time grazing and like Horses, the Zorse has an advanced sense of taste which allows it to sort through grasses and grains in search of its most favourable foods. The Zorse primarily eats grasses, herbs and flowers that grow on ground level, along with leaves, fruits and berries that it has to pull from the trees or finds on the floor. Zorses generally will not eat plants that are poisonous, but are known to resort to eating plants that contain toxins when there is not an adequate supply of more nutritious food. Oddly enough the Zorse\u2019s digestive system is designed to have food flowing through it almost continually, allowing them to graze nearly all day if they can. On the African plains, Zebras are an important source of food for a number of large carnivores including large felines such as Lions , Leopards, and Cheetahs along with Hunting Dogs and Hyenas. Zorses tend to be slightly larger in size than Zebras (depending on the size of their mother) and so would be a bit harder for these powerful predators to kill. In their native habitats, wild Horses are preyed upon by Wolf packs or Bears that try to single out a generally smaller or weaker individual from the herd. The biggest threat to both wild Horses and Africa\u2019s Zebra populations, though, is habitat loss either in the form of growing human settlements or to clear land for agriculture, with populations declining throughout much of their natural ranges. The Zorse is a cross between a Zebra stallion and a domestic mare, but it is also possible to use a Zebra mare and a domestic stallion. This is not that common, however, because owners of valuable Zebra mares don\u2019t want to waste a year of their breeding life trying to produce a hybrid when they could be producing a Zebra foal instead. In Africa, Zebras and Horses are often crossbred to create Zorses that are used as trekking animals to transport both people and goods up and down the mountains. As with their Zebra father, the pattern of the Zorse\u2019s bold stripes is unique to each animal (much like the fingerprint of Humans) , meaning that they can be easily distinguished from one another, and if they were found naturally in the wild it could give them some form of camouflage into their surrounding environment. The Zorse was originally bred in England and Africa to try and produce a domestic Horse-like animal that was resistant to diseases spread by the Tse Tse Fly in Africa (Zebras have a natural resistance where domestic Donkeys and Horses do not). The experimental crosses were actually becoming popular until early in the 20th century when the ever-improving car industry meant that fewer and fewer people were using Horses for transport. At that point crossbreeding was largely abandoned until a revival of interest came in the early 1990s, with just about every breed of domestic horse imaginable being tried. Zorses are bred and kept today for riding, as work animals, and as attractions in zoos and animal institutes around the world. Due to the fact that the Zorse is a crossbred animal and that it cannot continue a population, it is not listed by the IUCN. The three Zebra species, though, are all listed, with the Plains Zebra as Least Concern, the Mountain Zebra as Vulnerable, and the Grevy\u2019s Zebra as Endangered. The Przewalski\u2019s Horse, which is the only species of wild Horse remaining, is actually Critically Endangered with populations falling so low that reintroduction schemes began reintroducing captive individuals back into their natural environment.",

        "Text": "\u201cWriting spiders can pluck webs like guitar strings to communicate with a mate. Almost like, they are playing songs to get their attention. \u201c The writing spider is a mostly passive carnivorous pest that is as shy as it is small. It feasts on smaller pests like Aphids, flies , mosquitos , and gnats. While their bite is similar to that of a bee sting, it can be dangerous for individuals with a weaker immune system. Writing spiders is one of 88 species of Argiope spiders that include the Argiope bruennichi and the Argiope anasuja . The common factor that lies throughout the genus of these spiders is the markings that they have on their abdomen. These spiders exist throughout multiple countries across the world and are especially prevalent in most tropical countries. Writing spiders, also known as garden spiders, belong to the Araneidae family, which spin these unique orb webs. There are more than 3,000 species of Araneidae in various countries, as they come in a variety of sizes and patterns. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Here are a few: Female spiders keep a single web in places where they are less likely to move, mainly due to their poor vision. They are easily recognizable thanks to their yellow and black markings throughout the lower abdomen. The spider earns its name \u201cwriting spider\u201d due to its unique behavior of weaving a zig-zag pattern in the center of its web, serving to stabilize the expansive structure, while also employing web vibrations as a defense mechanism when disturbed. According to the old myth surrounding writing spiders, if someone disrupts or damages the web of a writing spider, it is believed that the spider will reweave the web and inscribe the person\u2019s name. The superstition suggests that the individual whose name is written will meet their demise before sundown the following day. The Argiope aurantia, commonly known as the yellow garden spider, is found in Central and North America, with its highest concentration in the eastern part of its range. They can be seen in various habitats like near water bodies, grassy hillsides, and woodlands. The spider is often spotted in areas affected by human activities, such as roadsides, farms, and gardens. Writing spiders tend to stand out when compared to others even in their genus. Their yellow and black markings instantly stand out, providing visual clues for their distinct appearance. On the other hand, they also spin unique zigzag webs, which is also one of their recognizable characteristics. Writing Spiders rarely leave their webs, spinning one in a place where they will experience the least disturbance. Due to their weak eyesight, they rely on their sensitive touch and changes in air pressure to \u201csee.\u201d Even male spiders make their presence to female spiders known by strumming their webs to create specific vibrations. The female yellow garden spiders can be as big as 1.2 inches, while male spiders are usually less than 0.6 centimeters in size. Female spiders will also have the characteristic yellow bands and silver-looking hairs on their body. The wasp spider also looks very similar to the writing spiders, with the main difference being that the former has black and yellow stripes running horizontally throughout the body. This species of spider can be very passive and only really attack when provoked. Similar to common house spiders , writing spiders can make their webs in various corners of a home. They can be very shy and rarely ever seek out people to harm. Therefore, they can usually co-exist with humans , as long as no one touches their web. Other common places where you can find these spiders include bushes, shrubs, and gardens, where they find most of their prey. These spiders usually exist in woodlands, grassy hillsides, and near bodies of water. They are also very popular in places where two distinct habitats meet, specifically, those that they feast on. These types of unique habitats prove to be very beneficial, as they rarely have to leave. Writing spiders can have many predators out in the wild. Some can include spider wasps and shrews along with lizards and birds . Humans can also be predators of these writing spiders, even if they do not consume them after. Unlike hunting spiders like the wolf spider , writing spiders spend most of their time on their webs. They do not go out and hunt for food it instead comes to them. Female spiders will even consume their mates after reproducing. Writing spiders and humans can peacefully coexist, especially since they usually build their webs where you go the least. But if you wish that they would leave your house, you can easily get them out by removing their source of food. The food you eat can usually attract insects like ants or flies , which can attract these spiders. Keeping your house clean and getting rid of food residue can be a good way to ensure they stay away from your home. You can also peacefully relocate the spider by trapping them in a jar and releasing them in some bushes. Another good way to relocate them is by tearing down their web once or twice. If they feel like they are not safe in a specific location, they will move. Peppermint spray can be an effective deterrent as well. Writing spiders mostly reside in shrubbery and gardens, where they can catch plenty of prey. However, their choice of habitat can also put them in proximity to their predators. Juvenile writing spiders usually fall prey to jumping spiders and bigger garden spiders fall prey to spider wasps . Interestingly, jumping spiders can also fall prey to bigger writing spiders when trapped in their web. Birds are also a common threat to these spiders, as they can easily pick out the spiders from the shrubbery. Mating between writing spiders is usually quick, as the male spider plucks the web of a female spider to get her attention. The male also attaches a web to a separate surface, so that it can make a quick escape if the female tries to attack. If the female accepts the mate, the male will have an uncontrollable seizure after copulation. The male dies shortly after and the female later consumes him. Female writing spiders will usually mate in the spring or in the fall, which is also when they create a sac for their eggs. They are capable of producing up to 1,400 eggs with a single mate, which will usually hatch in 60 to 90 days. If the female is mated in spring, the eggs will hatch in the summer, but if she is mated in fall, the spiders will continue to nestle in the sac until spring comes. Male writing spiders rarely ever live for more than a few months. Since they mate when they die, they rarely live long. On the other hand, female garden spiders can survive for many years if they mate in the spring. But if they mate in the fall, they usually die during the first major frost of the season. The population of this writing spider is currently stable, and they are abundant throughout the US, Canada, and Mexico. According to the National Wildlife Federation , these spiders are widespread and their populations are stable.",

        "Name": "Smooth Snake",
        "Genus": "Coronella",
        "Text": "The female smooth snake gives birth to live young instead of eggs. The smooth snake is among the most common species of continental Europe, but because they like to hide, they\u2019re somewhat secretive and difficult to find. As a non-venomous snake, they are considered to be mostly harmless to humans, but they can deliver a painful bite if you\u2019re not careful. This species should not be confused with the smooth green snake, which is an entirely separate species. The only thing similar about them is their name. The smooth snake can be found in grasslands, shrublands, mixed woodlands, and rocky areas throughout most of mainland Europe and parts of Western Asia. They live as far north as the Baltic region and as far east as the Caspian Sea. This is one of three native snake species in the UK (United Kingdom), where it has become increasingly endangered. They spend a lot of time hiding under rocks, holes, vegetation, and leaf litter, only venturing out to hunt and bask in the sun. The scientific name of the smooth snake is Coronella austriaca . Coronella is a Latin word meaning small crown; this is a reference to the black crown-like pattern on the head of the snake. Austriaca refers to the country of Austria (although their actual range is much larger). They are closely related to the southern smooth snake in the same genus. According to the IUCN Red List, the smooth snake is a species of least concern . Population numbers are unknown, but they appear to be decreasing in some parts of their range. Habitat loss is thought to be the main culprit for their decline. The smooth snake has a relatively short but stout body that reaches about 2 feet long on average, but they have been known to grow up to 3 feet in size as well. They can be identified by the brown, gray, or red skin color with two rows of small, irregularly shaped dark blotches running down the entire length of the body. In many specimens, these rows become fused around the head, forming what looks like a crown. Another thick dark stripe extends from the nostril to the neck area on each side of the head. Their skin is said to be smooth and flat to the touch. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Here is how to identify the smooth snake: The smooth snake does not have the ability to produce any venom. Although they can deliver a somewhat painful bite, they are considered to be fairly harmless to humans overall. If you do happen to be bitten by one, then you should wash the wound out with soap and water to prevent an infection. Medical care is rarely necessary unless the wound fails to heal properly. The smooth snake is not very aggressive toward people at all. They would much rather run away and hide under vegetation or a rock than stand their ground and fight. Their main means of defense if a person or predator gets too close is to secrete a foul-smelling substance from the anal gland that can trigger nausea and sickness. This can make them very difficult to handle. The smooth snake is not easy to find and rarely sold as a pet even by specialty reptile stores. Some people may confuse this with smooth green snakes, which make much better pets and are generally easier to care for and handle. However, the smooth green snake is not closely related at all; in fact, it\u2019s a native of North America rather than Europe.",

        "Text": "Starfish, also known as sea stars, are some of the most important members of the underwater kingdom. Although they aren\u2019t technically fish, sea stars are animals that are still present in nearly every coastal habitat and can be found as low as the abyssal layer. You can identify a starfish by its bumpy skin and flat center surrounded by long limbs that give the appearance of a star. These slow-moving but sensitive fish come in a wide array of colors; although you should never pick one up, trying to find starfish along the beach is a wonderful seaside activity. Starfish also known as Asterozoans are a diverse and ecologically successful group of spiked-skinned echinoderms that happened to first appear in fossil records close to 500 million years ago. They appeared in the Ordovician period. In fact, starfish are the most primitive member of the Asterozoan family. Additionally, the five arms of starfish are leftovers from these ancient ancestors. Today, starfish are found all over the world in different tropical coral reefs, coastal waters, and the world\u2019s oceans. Not only that, but starfish most likely evolved from ancient animals called crinoids. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Although ancient fossils reveal starfish have been around for a very long time, due to pollution and other man-made reasons, starfish risk a decline in population numbers. The aquatic animal that is commonly known as a starfish is also frequently called a sea star. All of these animals fall into the class Asteroidea; in the scientific community, they are frequently known as asteroids. The zoological name Asteroidea translates to \u201cstar-shaped \u2013 \u201caster\u201d means \u201cstar,\u201d and \u201ceidos\u201d refers to \u201cshape.\u201d Asteroidea is one of the largest classes in the Echinodermata family. Other echinoderms include sea urchins , sea cucumbers, and sand dollars. Most echinoderms have the same five-pointed structure as common sea stars, but plenty of these animals \u2013 including some of the different types of starfish \u2013 are capable of having far more complicated structures. There are over 2,000 distinct species of starfish, and more are frequently discovered during oceanic research. The many types of these animals are as varied as the different places where they are found. With so many bright colors and creative forms, it\u2019s no surprise that so many sea stars have colloquial and zoological names that express their unique types of beauty. Some of the most notable types include: Starfish are flat aquatic animals that move slowly and stick to the ocean floor. Most of them have a central disk surrounded by five or more arms. The mouth is usually located in the middle of the disk, and the ends of their arms feature light-sensitive eyespots. The skin is covered in small spines, and the bottom of its limbs is usually lined with hundreds of small tubular feet that are used for gradual movement. Starfish are animals that come in an amazing array of colors and variations. From bold purple stripes to pointed black horns, there\u2019s no limit to the different types you might find. There are small species that are only an inch or two across, and there are large starfish that can get as big as a foot. Every region is different; you may need to take a walk along the beach to see your local sea stars. These animals are found along every coast in the world. Because they use seawater as part of their vascular system, they cannot live in any type of freshwater. You can find them in coral reefs, muddy bays, underwater kelp forests, and pretty much every other kind of aquatic environment. Although there are starfish all over the world, this species is still considered to be near threatened . Human presence has destroyed many of the coral reefs that house the world\u2019s different starfish species. These animals are incredibly important to their local ecosystems, and the recent decline of their species has threatened the biodiversity of many different regions. These animals are carnivores that consume nearly all types of small ocean life. Depending on where they live, they may eat mussels, oysters , clams, sea snails, fish , and even other starfish. These animals are also seen as prey by many different types of ocean-faring life. Mammals like seals and otters may choose to eat them as a snack; other threats include birds , crabs , and large carnivorous fish. These animals are solitary creatures, but they come together in large groups for mating purposes on a semi-yearly basis. They typically mate by pairing off with an opposite-gender partner. Both sea stars will release a spawn cloud into the water; once the eggs are fertilized, they will drift to the ocean floor. These animals do not appear to care for their young after the eggs are laid. The embryos hatch before they are fully developed; as the young grow, they will slowly gain limbs and assume their adult form. These animals can live to be up to 40 years old and will continue to develop and regrow their limbs as they age. These animals have not eaten as a staple food anywhere in the world. Some exotic restaurants sell fried starfish; however, between the fact that they are naturally toxic and the various state- and federal-level regulations on the sale of this sea animal, these restaurants are seldom profitable enough to continue providing them as a product.",

        "Text": "The thornback ray is a cartilaginous fish preferring to dwell on sea floors either in deeper water or along the coast. Its alternate name, the thornback skate, is more accurate given that this fish is actually a skate, not a ray. It lives in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, mostly along European and West African coastlines. This skate is a popular sport fish with anglers, though many choose to catch and release it due to its conservation status. Thornback Ray Fish Facts The scientific name for the thornback ray is Raja clavata . Alternate names for this fish include thornback skate, maiden ray, and rough ray. Although its common name includes the word \u201cray,\u201d it is technically a skate. Among other differences, rays have stingers on their tails while skates typically have spines on their backs. The thornback ray belongs to the class Chondrichthyes, which comprises cartilaginous fishes. These fish primarily have cartilage instead of bone. Its subclass, Elasmobranchii, includes sharks, rays, skates, and sawfish. It further belongs to the order Rajiformes (over 500 species of rays and skates), the family Rajidae (over 200 species of skates), and the genus Raja (16 species of skates). The thornback ray is flat and kite-shaped with distinctive wings ending in points. It uses these wings to move underwater. Its tail is long and fleshy, but like the tails of all other skates, it lacks a stinger. It may, however, have spines. The dorsum is prickly, though large females may also have spines on their ventral region. Juveniles and large males may have spines along the bottoms of their snouts and the edges of their discs. Adults often have \u201cbucklers\u201d (button-like growths) at the bases of their disc spines. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . In all individuals, the dorsum is brownish or greyish with brown or grey spots. The underbelly is white, fading to grey at the edges. Though this species has a small downward-facing mouth, its jaws are powerful. Two nostrils just above the mouth are sometimes mistaken for eyes. The rostrum (snout) is rounded. Male thornback rays grow up to 41 inches in length while females are somewhat larger, up to 55 inches in length. However, the average length for this species is 33.5 inches. Disc width (width from wingtip to wingtip) for adults is a minimum of 15 inches. The largest individual on record weighed just under 40 pounds. Thornback rays thrive in marine environments, typically coastal waters. Though they are saltwater fish, they are capable of surviving in lower salinity. They are also demersal, meaning they tend to lurk along the sea floor. This species inhabits areas of the Atlantic and Southwest Indian Oceans, notably along the coasts of Europe and West and South Africa. It also lives in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. These fish prefer to live at a depth of approximately 30-100 feet, though scientists have discovered some individuals at depths of nearly 3,350 feet. They often camouflage themselves in sediments on the ocean floor like mud, sand, and gravel, especially during the day. Their coloration makes it easy for them to blend in. Conservationists do not know the exact number of thornback rays in the world, but they believe that their populations are declining. For this reason, the IUCN lists this species as Near Threatened. Below is a list of the 67 countries and islands this fish inhabits. Thornback rays and other members of the Rajiformes order have left behind relatively little evidence of their evolutionary history. This is due to their cartilaginous skeletons, which are softer than bone and therefore do not easily fossilize. Northern Africa and southern Europe have yielded the majority of the earliest fossils, mostly in the form of teeth and scales. The available evidence suggests that the thornback ray\u2019s ancestors date back to the Lower Jurassic 150 million years ago, though they most likely began to split off from sharks as far back as 200 million years. Most of the current taxonomical groupings appear to have developed from the Upper Cretaceous 100 million years ago to the Paleocene 50 million years ago. Some scientists speculate that rays and skates have experienced greater speciation (diversity) than sharks due to the more diverse range of benthic (sea floor) environments. Strangely enough, some shark species remain more closely related to rays and skates than to other sharks. The phylogenetic development of the thornback ray is uncertain, though scientists have studied European populations to measure their diversity. They found that populations in the Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Black Seas all shared a single mitochondrial haplotype, which is a region of DNA that helps to show maternal lineages. British populations, however, had a second mitochondrial haplotype that differentiated them from some other European populations. Evidence suggests that thornback ray numbers expanded significantly between 580,000 and 362,000 years ago. Thornback rays are carnivorous, opportunistic feeders that survive by camouflaging themselves on the ocean floor. As nocturnal animals, they are usually active at night and rest during the day. Their favored method of hunting is to grab prey as it swims by or as it rests on the sea bed. Despite their ability to hide, they have a number of natural predators besides humans. Thornback rays, both adults and juveniles, eat crustaceans like amphipods, shrimp, and crabs. Fully grown individuals also enjoy sand eels and other small fish. Because of their powerful jaws and sharp teeth, they are able to crack the hard outer shells of crustaceans. Humans are one of the primary predators of the thornback ray. Other potential threats include seals and shark species like angel sharks and bluntnose sixgill sharks. Some fish, like the Atlantic cod or grey gurnard, also prey on this species. Thornback rays prefer deeper waters in winter, but when temperatures rise, they move to shallower waters to breed. Females typically migrate a month before the males, who follow afterward. Their breeding season lasts from February to September, though June sees the most activity. The polyandrous females usually mate with more than one male. This species is oviparous, meaning it lays eggs that then develop and hatch outside the mother\u2019s body. It is also characterized by single oviparity, which means each egg contains only one embryo. The eggs are ovular and pointed at both ends. Females usually only lay once or twice a year, producing up to 170 eggs annually, though the average number is 48-74. Females lay their eggs in winter, spring, or summer, depositing them in the sediment on the sea floor. The eggs hatch after four to five months. The newly hatched pups are between 4.3 and 5.1 inches long. They survive by feeding on the yolk from the eggs. Sexual maturity occurs at about seven to eight years of age, usually sooner for males than females. The maximum lifespan for this species is 15 years. It is legal in most places to fish for thornback rays, both recreationally and commercially. Though it may come as a surprise to many, some people enjoy eating this fish. The best time to fish for this fish near shore is from May to September, though they move inland as early as February. After September, they return to deeper waters. Anglers are likely to find these fish swimming in areas with sediments like sand, mud, or gravel. Rocky or rough ground is unlikely to harbour this species. The best bait for thornback rays is whole small fish like sprats, though parts of larger fish like mackerel, herring, or pilchard may also generate good results. Fishermen can also try using bait like sand eels, worms, and crustaceans. Anyone attempting to handle this fish after catching it should exercise caution as both its teeth and its spines are sharp. Commercial fisheries also fish for this species in various areas like the Irish and Celtic Seas, the eastern English Channel, the North Sea, Skagerrak, and Kattegat. Methods of catching this fish include seines, otter trawls, bottom trawls, and trammel nets. The United Kingdom\u2019s Southern IFCA (Inland Fisheries and Conservation Authorities) estimates that fisheries caught 107 tons of thornback rays in their district in 2019. Thornback rays are good for eating with a number of acceptable preparation methods including frying, baking, or saut\u00e9ing. With leaner meat like this, it\u2019s best to prepare it with oil or sauce. The UK\u2019s The Telegraph featured this recipe for thornback ray with cockles and brown butter . BBC Good Food recommends preparing this fish with buttery parsley and capers . For those interested in a more comprehensive experience, this guide shows readers how to catch, skin, and cook this unique fish. Because its mean is so lean , this species is an excellent choice for people watching their fat intake. 100 grams of thornback ray meat contains about 68 calories, 14.2 grams of protein, 0.9 grams of fat, and 0.7 grams of carbohydrate.",

They belong to the family Colletidae , which contains over 2000 species of bees! Hylaeus contains over 500 species , and North America is home to 130 species of them. They are distinctive for the yellow, white, or black markings on their faces. Because many of the species have white-to-cream-colored faces, many bee enthusiasts believe that yellow-faced bee is a misnomer . Such individuals choose to refer to species in the genus as masked bees. Hylaeus are important pollinators, playing a crucial role in the pollination of wildflowers and agricultural crops. Unlike honey bees, they do not produce honey or live in large colonies. Yellow-faced bees make their nests in soft, pithy stems or cavities in wood. As a solitary species, yellow-faced bees do not have a worker caste. All female bees are essentially the queens of their own nests. Females of the species are solely responsible for all aspects of reproduction. From finding a mate, building a nest, constructing and provisioning brood cells, and depositing and fertilizing the eggs, she does it all. What other characteristic traits do the 500 + species of the genus Hyleaus have in common? Keep reading to find out! The scientific name Hylaeus comes from the Greek word hyle , which means wood, timber, or forest. Johan Christian Fabricius (1745-1808), a student of Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), the father of modern taxonomy, chose the name for this genus. In classical Greek mythology, Hylaeus and his brother Rhoecus were centaur woodsmen. This name is fitting for the bees in this genus, as they are often associated with woody plants, which provide habitats and food for these important pollinators. Despite the name, bees in the genus Hylaeus are not limited to forests and woodlands and also forage in a wide range of other habitats, including deserts, grasslands, urban areas, and backyard gardens. Yellow-faced bees are small, They range in size from 0.2-0.4 inches (5-11 mm) in length, with a similar wingspan. of 0.12 to 0.31 inches (3 to 8 mm). They have black, nearly hairless bodies, with yellow or white markings on their faces. Males of the species are typically more colorful, but smaller than the females. Male faces are yellow or white around their eyes and lower faces. Females are notable for their devil horns, two distinct triangles of color on either side of their eyes. These bees are often mistaken for wasps because of the absence of setae (singularly, seta) on their bodies which are typical of many bee species. Setae are the bristly hairs that many species of bees use to collect pollen. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Yellow-faced bees have five eyes: two compound eyes and three simple eyes, also called ocelli, plural or singularly, ocellus. Compound eyes are large, bulging eyes that cover most of the bee\u2019s head. Ommatidia (singularly ommatidium ) are the lenses that are responsible for the bees\u2019 true vision. Compound eyes are good at detecting movement, but they have poor resolution and color vision. Simple eyes are smaller eyes located on the top of the bee\u2019s head, between the compound eyes. They are sensitive to light and dark and are used to regulate the bee\u2019s circadian rhythm and navigation. The one characteristic that is common to all bees in the genus Hylaeus , is their solitary behavior. They do not live in colonies like honey bees and bumblebees . As solitary bees, they do not have distinct queen, drone, and worker castes like social bees. Because each female yellow-faced bee is responsible for constructing and provisioning her own nest and laying eggs, no worker caste is necessary. Male masked bees do not have specialized worker duties and do not help with nest construction or care of the young. Females across the genus are responsible for building their nests, constructing brood cells, and provisioning the cells with nectar and pollen stores off of which her larvae will feed. Nesting habits across the species are highly variable and dependent on the availability of suitable nesting sites, and specific environmental conditions. Many yellow-faced bees construct their brood cells in pithy plant stems, and some others burrow into tree bark. Still, others will burrow into the ground.After she has constructed her brood cells, usually no more than 12, the female yellow-faced bee forages for the nectar and pollen with which she will fill them. Yellow-faced bees carry pollen and nectar in their crops. The crop is commonly referred to as the honey stomach. It is an organ that is used to transport nectar and pollen back to the nesting site to provision brood cells. The female yellow-face deposits one egg in each cell, before carefully sealing the cells to protect her eggs from changes in temperature and humidity. Once the female yellow-faced bee has sealed her brood cells, depending on the specific species, she will either leave the nest never to return or hover around the nest\u2019s entrance warding off would-be predators. Males of the genus primarily mate and forage. Yellow-faced bees are effective and important pollinators. Over time, the genus Hylaeus has diversified and spread, colonizing a wide range of habitats and adapting to different climatic conditions. Today, the genus includes over 500 species, with a significant portion of these occurring in Europe, Asia, and North America. Some species of yellow-faced bees will excavate their own nest sites in the stems of woody plants, while others will make use of existing holes and crevices in the bark of trees. Some species nest in the soil, in which they dig their own burrows. Despite this variability, all yellow-faced bees build individual nests. They do not live in colonies. This widespread genus lives in forests or deserts and everything in between. As long as there is a food source, these enterprising insects will find a way. Yellow-faced bees are resilient and adaptable. They are able to persist and thrive in a wide range of environments around the world. Yellow-faced bees forage on a variety of plant species, depending on their species and the availability of food resources in its local environment. Some of the preferred plant species for foraging by masked bees include: These small, solitary bees are highly effective pollinators due to their behavior and anatomy. Yellow-faced bees have long, slender tongues that allow them to reach the nectar of many types of flowers, including those with long, tubular corollas. They are efficient pollinators, visiting many flowers in quick succession, and spreading pollen as they go. Hylaeus bees play a critical role in maintaining the health and diversity of their environments. Yellow-faced bees face various predators, including birds, reptiles, spiders, and other insects. Some common predators of masked bees include birds like chickadees and nuthatches. Lizards, like anoles, geckos, and skinks are opportunistic feeders that eat a wide variety of insects, including yellow-faced bees. Garter snakes, rat snakes, and king snakes will all nosh on a yellow-faced bee given the chance. Spiders will wait near the entrance of the bees\u2019 nests, capturing them as they emerge. Other insects, such as wasps and hornets, are also known to prey on the larvae of yellow-faced bees. Parasitic wasps will deposit their eggs in the brood cells of the bees. The wasp larvae feed on the bee larvae, to its demise. Among the key threats facing masked bees are: Ninty-three species of Hylaeus are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . Their classifications range from data deficient to near threatened. This is not surprising given the genus is so widespread, which makes it difficult to track. Populations of yellow-faced bees are not well-recorded. However, research is determining that bees across all genera are declining at an alarming rate. Therefore it would follow that the population of yellow face bees is on the decline. The lifecycle of bees in the genus Hylaeus involves four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The one commonality across the genus is that adult bees tend to die off as winter approaches. However, depending on the precise species, the timing of their lifecycle stages looks very different. Some species of Hylaeus bees have a short development time, with the eggs hatching, the larvae pupating, and emerging as adult bees within a matter of weeks. However, other species of Hylaeus bees have a longer development time and overwinter as larvae within the nest before emerging as adult bees in the spring or summer, to complete the lifecycle once again. The exact timing of development and emergence can vary depending on the species and environmental conditions. Adult bees in the genus have very different experiences. While females are occupied with building nests and constructing and provisioning brood cells, the males of the genus solely forage and mate. The lifespan of an adult yellow-faced bee can vary depending on the species and environmental conditions. Yellow-faced bees\u2019 lifespans are measured in weeks and months.",

        "Text": "Robber Flies are flies that are known for their aggressive predator habits and can attack their prey mid-flight. They are found in abundance across the world and belong to a diverse insect family. Robber flies get their name because of their hostile behavior while attacking prey. They hide on their perches and suddenly attack prey by pouncing on them as soon as they get the chance. They also imitate bees or wasps to prey on other insects. The Robber Flies belong to the family Asilidae and are of the order Diptera . They belong to the broad group of species that pounce on their prey mid-air. People often refer to these flies as assassin flies because of their predatory behavior. They are sometimes mistaken for biting flies or horseflies , but this is a misconception. Robber Flies may be aggressive to their prey, but they do not drink blood and they are not predators of humans. However, if you provoke them, they might bite in self-defense. Robber flies are spread around the whole world and include more than 7000 species. Of this number, 1000 are only found in North America . This species is still being observed and new facts are being discovered even today. The currently accepted sub-families are as follows: The female Robber Flies lay their whitish eggs on low-lying grasses or in the crevices of bark or soil. The nest depends on the type of abdomen that the female possesses. Depending on its morphology, the female may lay the eggs away from the nest, within the soil, or in cavities of plant cells. Amounts of eggs laid are unknown. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The eggs carry micro sculptures that are only visible under observation through a microscope. They are typically either oval or spherical but are always almost 0.07 inches long. The eggs hatch into a larva that is white or yellowish. The larva is predatory and may feed on eggs, other larvae, and small insects to survive. They migrate in the winter to pupate under the soil and emerge as grown adults. The total time for a larva to become an adult takes one to three years but their growth as larvae is accelerated in the warmer regions. The Robber Flies measure up to 0.39 to 0.59 inches in length, making them the largest of all flies. Many Robber Flies are long and slender, with tapered abdomens similar to damsel flies. Some of the species are short and stout, resembling bumblebees . The Robber Flies have beak-like heads that are pointed and stiff. This pointy head serves as a weapon. It is first used as a dagger to kill, then as a needle to inject the poison for killing the prey, and finally as a straw to gobble up the broken-down food. They have hairy bodies and their mouth parts are also covered in a tuft of hair. Most of the Robber Flies are black or brown. Sexual dimorphism is also quite visible but not to an extreme extent. The females have a broader abdomen to carry eggs after mating. Another interesting characteristic is their eyes. One compound eye is present on either side of its head and can see two different fields of view. This allows Robber Flies to observe a different stimuli at the same time. The Robber Flies have short and hairy antennae and long and slender legs. Their six legs have fleshy pads on their ends and are great for holding down prey. You can typically spot 6 to 8 hairy segments on their bodies but sometimes the last segments are obscured. Robber Flies have only one pair of wings. The behavior of the Robber Flies is both aggressive and predatory. They can eat any flying insect they see, which may be the reason why their population can be large in a very small area. Their mating behavior is quite effective. A female judges their partner and observes whether the male fellow is worthy. If they do not find the male to be a good mate, they pretend they are dead. Finding the female unresponsive, the male drops the female and flies away in search of another. The Robber Flies have a cosmopolitan distribution. This means that they are either found all over the world or in most parts of the globe. There are over 7000 species of this particular insect currently discovered world-wide, however, they are not found in Antarctica. Their population rate is quite high. They can spread quickly and are often found in huge numbers in small areas. This is likely due to their eating habits which suggest they can eat up to 1 to 2% of the flying insects in the region they have inhabited. More specifically, you can spot them in open areas so they can fly to hunt and then grasp their prey. Any open areas like grasslands , fields, ponds and streams, marshes, and crevices in woody areas are some examples. They usually have a perched area that allows them to give space to eat their prey safely after hunting. The Robber Flies are aggressive eaters and predators. They can sight their prey from afar and grasp them in mid-air for a fulfilling meal. They have a needle-like head that injects venom to subdue the prey. This venom has an enzyme that can break down the body of the victim, allowing Robber Flies to digest their food easily. Their larvae eat other\u2019s eggs, larvae, and even small insects. As for the adults, they can eat any flying insect in sight. These include beetles, grasshoppers, butterflies, bees, wasps, and even hummingbirds . They can easily consume one to two prey a day. Their predators include lizards, birds, bats, large spiders, frogs , etc. The Robber Flies are not dangerous to people. They do not attack humans and are beneficial to the environment as they can help reduce pest populations. However, it is better to be careful around them because if provoked or mishandled, they might bite. Check out some of our other insect articles.",

        "Text": "\u201cThe olive baboon forms one of the most complex social structures in the animal kingdom.\u201d This baboon is a type of old-world monkey (a monkey species from the Eastern Hemisphere) that roams across various habitats of Africa . They have numerous adaptations to help them survive and thrive in different environmental conditions. In this article, you will learn some interesting facts about the physical and behavioral characteristics, including reproduction, lifespan, and identification, of the olive baboon. The scientific name of the olive baboon is Papio anubis . This name is derived from the Egyptian god Anubis, whose dog head resembles the muzzle of the baboon. The species is closely related to the yellow baboon, Kinda baboon, chacma baboon, Guinea baboon, and hamadryas baboon within the genus of Papio. The scientific name Papio appears to have the same origin as the name baboon (which roughly means lips or muzzle). The olive baboon is a large monkey species, measuring up to three feet long, that generally moves around on all four legs. Some of its physical characteristics include a long tail, a long, protruding muzzle, forward-facing nostrils, deep-set eyes, a flat top head, and sharp claws. Most of the body, except for the bare face and rump, is covered in olive-gray or brown fur. These colors are produced by alternating pairs of black and dark yellow rings on each of the hairs. There is also a strong element of sexual dimorphism in this species (meaning the two sexes look radically different from each other). Males are much larger on average than females. They also possess a large shaggy mane and longer canine teeth. This should help with identification between the sexes. As a primate, the olive baboon has one of the most complicated social systems in the entire animal kingdom. The social structure, also known as the troop, consists of several males and females living together at once. Featuring up to 150 members, troops are absolutely vital for the survival of the baboon, because members travel, forage, groom, sleep together, and protect each other from dangerous predators. The troop is composed of separate male and female dominance hierarchies based on strength and seniority. Higher ranked members will have access to more food and mates. However, these hierarchies may change frequently, and relationships and friendships can be established between members of different ranks. Males tend to leave the troops of their births upon reaching maturity (and may continue to switch troops every few years as needed), whereas females tend to remain with the same troop for their entire lives. This enables the females to form lifelong associations with each other to aid with grooming and foraging, even though friendships are always superseded by the allegiance to family and kin members. Other important social adaptations of the troop are the male and female friendships. Females will help males integrate into the group (and sometimes even mate with them, but this isn\u2019t guaranteed). In turn, males will protect their female friends and sometimes even \u201cbabysit\u201d their infant while she forages. Her friend will even help her fend off unwanted advances from other males. Most social interactions, including mating opportunities, occur within the troop than between them. Troops tend to have their own territories and stay away from each other. While interactions between different troops can sometimes be quite friendly and genial, they do compete against each other for resources. Violence is fortunately rare. As you might expect, baboons exhibit incredibly complex behaviors to communicate with each other. For instance, a more dominant baboon may use his/her stare to threaten someone else without resorting to violence or aggression. Yawning or tooth display may be a show of power as well. Teeth chattering and lip-smacking are performed by dominant members to reassure other members of the troops, whereas rapid glances are done to reduce tension. Baboons will also crouch or keep their tail erect to show their submissiveness. Olive baboons can make a number of distinct vocalizations to convey their moods. A two-phase barking call is often directed toward predators or other males to warn them away, whereas a separate shrill barking call indicates the presence of a predator nearby. Grunting and roaring are also made during fights to appear intimidating. Screeching sounds convey strong emotional reactions. A yakking call is made to defuse tension while it retreats from a threatening situation. Olive baboons spend most of the time on the ground, but they are capable of climbing trees in order to provide a lookout or escape against predators. Their anatomy is incredibly versatile and adapted for both walking and climbing. Baboons are active during the day and spend about 60% of their time foraging. The rest of the day is spent on grooming and building relationships with each other. In the east African country of Eritrea , the olive baboon and African bu sh elephant have formed a symbiotic relationship with each other. The baboons are free to use the elephant\u2019s watering hole, and in return, they essentially provide a lookout service by emitting a loud call when potential predators are nearby. In this manner, the olive baboon and African bush elephant are mutually beneficial to each other. The olive baboon can be found in savannah, grasslands, deserts, and rainforests throughout central sub-Saharan Africa , from the Atlantic coast to the horn of Africa, which encompasses some 25 countries in total. There are also isolated populations within the Saharan Desert. Unlike most monkey species, baboons live primarily on the ground, but they are capable climbers as well. Olive baboons face a few threats from humans . They are sometimes shot, trapped, and poisoned in retaliation for consuming crops or livestock. They are also at risk of habitat loss from encroaching farms. However, this has not appeared to impact their population seriously enough to warrant a downgrade in their conservation status. Local farmers can sometimes deter baboons with domestic dogs and other methods. Baboons of all ages are in constant danger of falling victim to crocodiles , leopards , wild dogs , and hyenas . Chimpanzees and raptors will attack baby baboons as well. The safety of the group does provide some protection against predators. The diet of the olive baboon consists of many different foods, including rodents , birds , insects , fruits, roots, seeds, leaves, bark, flowers, fungi, and more. The baboons can dig through the dirt with their sharp claws to extract food sources. It can also kill animals as large as young antelope and farm animals. The ability to consume grasses for long periods of time enables them to exploit dry locations. They are also quite good at removing the sharp needles from prickly pears. The olive baboon follows a promiscuous mating strategy. While larger, stronger, and younger males tend to dominate access to mates, two males will sometimes form alliances with each other (especially between older males who are well-acquainted) to wrest away access from a third more dominant male. Sometimes a softer approach is required, however. Males will attempt to forge a bond with females by grooming, sharing food, and defending her from other baboons. Females appear to show a preference for mating with male friends. Mating can occur at any time throughout the year. Healthy females who have the most access to food (this is usually the highest ranked females) can breed annually; otherwise, they will breed once every 12 to 34 months. Because lactation causes a significant fall in the mother\u2019s weight, it requires a significant amount of time to recover from. After mating, the female will give birth to a single offspring about half a year later. Born with black coat colors and pink skin, the baby is completely dependent on the mother. She provides much of the nursing, grooming, and playtime, whereas the father plays a minimal role in parental duties. The fur will grow the olive gray colors at around the first year of age, but it takes more than 400 days before the baby is completely weaned off its mother\u2019s milk and begins eating solid food. The sexual maturity of the baboon is heavily dependent on its nutritional intake. If well-fed, it can reach full sexual maturity in as little as five or six years. Males will undergo several important changes in physical characteristics, including muscle growth, deeper voices, the eruption of the teeth, and the development of the mane. Before that point, identification of the sexes is very difficult. The lifespan of this species has never been accurately recorded, but based on observation of closely related baboons, it can probably live an average of 25 years. The olive baboon is considered to be a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List . Scientists do not have enough facts about their populations to determine or estimate their numbers.",
