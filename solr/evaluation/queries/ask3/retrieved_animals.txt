    "Name": "Coopers Hawk",
    "Fun_Fact": "Eyes change color as they age",
    "Text": "“The Cooper’s hawk is the stealthy and agile aerial predator of the American woodlands.” Cooper’s hawk is a bird known by many different names throughout North America, including the chicken hawk, striker, and flying cross. It is a medium-sized hawk that is often identified by its proportionally large head, black-banded tail feathers, and hunting habits under the canopy of wooded or forested areas. Even expert observers can easily confuse the identification of these hawks with similar related American hawks like the sharp-shinned hawk and northern goshawk . They spend most of their time in the canopy of densely wooded areas where they use their remarkable agility to stalk and ambush elusive prey species. They mostly eat smaller birds, but can also prey on mammals and insects. Cooper’s hawk has many common or local names, including chicken or hen hawk, quail hawk, swift hawk, big blue darter, striker, and flying cross. The species’ scientific name is Accipiter cooperii and they are members of the Accipitridae family in the Aves class. The name “Cooper” and “cooperii” are both derived from the original name given to the species by a French ornithologist who discovered it in 1828. He named it after the American naturalist William Cooper, his friend and contemporary, who also traversed the Americas to collect sample specimens of various animal species. The Cooper’s hawk is a bird with several key physical characteristics that are all adapted to increase their maneuverability, agility and stealth. They have relatively short wings compared to their size, with an average wingspan of about 33 inches. Their wings have distinctly rounded tips. They have very long tail feathers relative to wingspan and body size, which helps them precisely control their movements as they navigate around trees and make sharp mid-air turns to keep up with smaller, evasive birds. The hawk also has a relatively large head as well as a strong beak and talons that help it achieve a firm grip on its prey. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This medium-sized species ranges from 14 to 20 inches in total length, but this doesn’t stop them from targeting birds of comparable size. The average weight for a mature bird ranges from 1 to 1.5 pounds, with females being routinely larger than their male counterparts. In the United States, birds found nesting west of the Mississippi River is generally smaller than those east of the river. Body feathers range in color but are usually brownish or bluish-gray on the back and wings with a much lighter underbelly. Darker barring is usually seen across the underside. Unlike falcons and many of the more active raptor species, Cooper’s hawk is a patient and prudent predator that spends a lot of its time waiting in woodland canopies. They watch and listen for potential prey stealthily, relying on their camouflaged feathers to conceal them in the branches of trees. They prefer to ambush their prey and take them by surprise, but they are capable of remarkable burst speed to make a capture. However, they are usually unwilling to engage in lengthy pursuits and may break off the chase if their prey keeps distance for long enough. This species is an early riser and is more active in the dawn and morning hours than the afternoon. They also spend a substantial portion of their time preening on their roost to keep their feathers in perfect condition as they wait for prey. While they spend most of their time among the upper branches of trees, they sometimes take to the ground to hunt smaller mammals or take a drink from a secluded water source. Like many predatory birds, this hawk rarely makes a call or sound except as a warning against threats. Cooper’s hawks hunt almost exclusively in wooded areas with a tendency to stick to deciduous and mixed forests. They have a strong preference for temperate climates and their native range extends from southern portions of Canada through the entire continental United States to the northern portions of Central America. While they may remain in their local environment year-round, birds that live in Canada and the northern US tend to migrate south annually. Their smaller wings and long tail feathers are adaptations that help them navigate around trees and chase unpredictable prey. While they are capable of short bursts of speed, their body isn’t suited for diving or long pursuits like those of many other raptor species. Their dark and barred coloration also provides effective camouflage among the branches and treetops where they spend much of their time. Cooper’s hawk is an opportunistic carnivore that targets live prey and has a decent range of possible targets. Reported cases of these hawks consuming carrion are extremely rare. They have a definite preference for certain types of bird species as prey, but their diet can become flexible when the need arises. With common names like the hen hawk, quail hawk, and chicken hawk, Cooper’s hawk has an obvious preference for eating chickens, quail, and other plump fowl. They have long been a scourge of farmers, especially in centuries past, who had to worry about these hawks targeting their coops. Bats are another likely prey candidate for this hawk, as are most small to mid-sized bird species. Snakes , frogs , and various land mammals, including squirrels and chipmunks , may also fall prey to hungry hawks. This hawk is generally near the top of the food chain in its local environment, with potential predators limited to eagles and other larger birds. One of the biggest historical threats to the Cooper’s hawk was the widespread use of pesticides. These toxic agents infiltrated the food chain and reached high concentrations for hawks, falcons , and other predatory animals. Limitations in the use of these pesticides have allowed for some rebound and they are considered a species of least concern in terms of conservation. The species is not a source of food for humans, but they were once considered a fair target for shooting by people who wanted to protect their domesticated animals and local game birds. This practice was popular in the first half of the 20th century but was curtailed when the dwindling hawk population prompted conservation laws protecting them. Even though active shooting is now a minimal concern, these hawks are still sometimes hunted or poisoned to defend poultry or fowl. Even though their overall population is relatively stable, the Cooper’s hawk currently faces the ongoing threat of habitat loss. Logging activities and general encroachment by human development are slowly limiting their local ranges and forcing them into lower-quality environments. They have adapted to urban and suburban habitats with some success, but researchers are unsure of the long-term consequences or viability of this transition. These hawks tend to have only one mate per season, like most predatory birds, but this isn’t always the case. Mature adults also tend to select prospective mates of comparable size and pairings of larger individuals typically lay their eggs a bit earlier in the year than smaller birds. Courtship rituals are flexible and may involve just the male, just the female, or both at the same time. Mutual sky circling is a common occurrence alongside sky dances that may include arching, flaring, and other displays. Breeding and nest building usually takes place between February and March . In most cases, both members of the pair remain with the nest to gather food and defend their young. The nests are generally bulky structures made from sticks, bark, and assorted greenery. Hawks defending the nest may make a “kek” call to warn their partner when they feel threatened by a potential predator. Females generally lay 3 to 5 eggs that have a bluish-white shell. Both genders participate in incubating the eggs for about 35 days before they hatch. The chicks remain in the nest for 4 to 5 weeks before they start learning to fly. Wild birds have a life expectancy of 8 to 10 years, with the highest risk of mortality in the first year. The oldest known specimen tracked by banding reached an age of 20 years and 5 months. Despite intense persecution by humans and population reduction from pesticide exposure in the 20th century, the Cooper’s hawk has made a strong comeback. Their numbers are now estimated to be between 100,000 and 1 million across their entire native range and conservationists believe this number is currently stable. However, the continued destruction of habitat and threats to the population of desirable prey species could cause problems for them in the years ahead.",

    "Name": "Bigfin Reef Squid",
    "Fun_Fact": "Can change color through use of chromatophores",
    "Text": "Also known as the glitter squid or oval squid, the bigfin reef squid belongs to the loliginid squid family Loliginidae. They get their name from the large oval fin connected to the mantle. Although they rank as a medium-sized species and only measure around 1.5 to 13 inches long, they grow faster than almost any other large marine invertebrate. They engage in elaborate mating displays and live relatively short lives, with a maximum age of just 315 days. The bigfin reef squid goes by many other names, including the oval squid, glitter squid, and green-eyed squid. In Australia, people sometimes refer to it as the northern calamari. Its genus name, Sepioteuthis, derives from the Greek words sepia, meaning “cuttlefish,” and teuthis, or “squid.” This name references the similarities in appearance between the bigfin reef squid and another cephalopod, the cuttlefish . Like other members of their genus, bigfin reef squids feature characteristic oval fins through the mantle that distinguishes them from other squids. These fins extend anywhere from 83% to 97% of the mantle lengths and up to 70% of the mantle width. Due to these fins, people often mistake them for cuttlefish. The mantle appears cylindrical and tapers to a cone at the end. At its longest, the mantle can measure up to 15 centimeters long, with males typically measuring larger than females. Males typically weigh between 0.9 and 3.1 pounds, while females weigh from 0.3 to 2.3 pounds. Bigfin reef squids possess large eyes and strong, curved beaks. They have 2 tentacles as well as 8 arms of varying lengths. The arms measure thickest near the body and taper to a narrow point. Each arm possesses two rows of suckers, with each sucker measuring less than 2 millimeters wide and sporting a ring of sharp teeth. Living bigfin reef squids range in color, including translucent white, pale yellow, and brownish pink. Chromatophores cover the top of the head, mantle, and arms but not the underside of the fins. These chromatophores allow bigfin reef squids to rapidly change body color and patterns in a process called metachrosis. Additionally, they possess iridophores in the head, which produce iridescent red and green lights when exposed to light. Depending on their age, bigfin reef squids exhibit both shoaling and schooling behavior. Juvenile squids often swim together in groups, although not parallel to each other like some schooling fish . Also, unlike some other squids, adult bigfin reef squids rarely cannibalize one other. This allows squids of different sizes to swim together without the threat of larger members attacking and eating the smaller ones. In the presence of light, bigfin squids display intense phototactic responses. They will move close to the light and then stop all other movements. This behavior does not vary based on the color of the light, but stronger lights appear to generate a more powerful response. You will most likely encounter bigfin reef squids in warm, shallow water. They commonly inhabit depths up to 328 feet below sea level. Their preferred habitats include regions near shorelines, rocky outcroppings, and coral reefs, hence their name. The juveniles often congregate under driftwood or other obstructions to avoid predators, particularly during the daytime. Bigfin reef squids are carnivorous predators that eat various marine life. They often hunt at night and retreat to deeper waters to hide during the day. Their diet consists primarily of prawns , crustaceans, and fish. They use their tentacles to grab and their 8 arms to hold onto their prey while they eat. Their strong, curved beaks are immensely powerful and perfectly suited for tearing flesh or breaking shells. While they can eat once every few hours, they also go up to 24 hours between eating meals. Several species prey on bigfin squids, including marlin, tuna , swordfish, sharks , whales, and groundfish. They are most vulnerable during their larval stage when their small size makes them especially susceptible to predators. Bigfin reef squids rely on their camouflage skills and ink sacs to avoid and escape from predators, respectively. They also have rather acute hearing compared to most cephalopods, which allows them to detect nearby predators. Although adult bigfin reef squids rarely cannibalize one another, cannibalism frequently occurs among juveniles. In addition to predators, bigfin reef squids also serve as hosts for several marine parasites such as Doricicola similis, Dicyema koshidae , and Dicyema orientale. Although bigfin reef squids often spawn in May, they can mate and lay eggs year-round. They typically engage in two different posturing behaviors. The first is called “accentuated gonads,” in which the squid draws attention to its sexual organs by making its mantle translucent while the gonads appear bright white. The second method is often used by the males and is called spread arms. This tactic involves the squid tilting its body forward and spreading its arms widely, and most often occurs when a male pursues a prospective female mate. When mating, bigfin reef squids employ several approaches, most of which last for only a few seconds. Sometimes, a male may swim rapidly back and forth beside a female before quickly depositing his spermatophores inside the female’s mouth funnel. Smaller males may also sneak up on females while they court a larger male in the hopes of successfully mating while the females are distracted. Other times, males and females may swim together side by side until the male directly deposits his spermatophore into the female’s mantle cavity at the opening of the oviduct. Female bigfin reef squids can lay anywhere from 20 to 1180 eggs throughout their lives. They can lay eggs year-round and die shortly after spawning. The eggs are often attached to rocks, corals, plants, or other underwater surfaces. After incubating for around 3 weeks, the larval squids emerge. They develop rapidly and can exhibit complex color-shifting behavior shortly after birth that doesn’t develop until much later in most other squid species. Males reach sexual maturity at around 140 days, while females sexually mature between 156 and 196 days old. The oldest bigfin reef squid ever recorded lived a total of 315 days, which represents a relatively short lifespan compared to other squids. Due to their rapid growth rate and abundance, bigfin reef squids are among the most commercially popular squid species. Every year, fishers harvest millions of bigfin squids from the ocean through trawling, seine fishing, and net traps. While most abundant during full moons and in foggy weather, their populations remain stable year-round. This likely has to do with the fact that they do not breed seasonally, so populations are constantly replaced. Despite their increasing importance as a food source, their worldwide population remains stable. As a result, bigfin reef squids have become the subject of much debate concerning their viability for mariculture. The bigfin reef squid is the most popular species in the genus Sepio teuthis. You can find them throughout the temperate and tropical waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Their native range extends from the Hawaiian Islands to the Red Sea and from Japan to Australia and New Zealand. In recent years, their range has expanded to include parts of the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea. Given their fast growth rate, fecundity, and widespread distribution, bigfin reef squids are extremely prolific. Their abundance makes them extremely important to commercial fishing operations, and they are a popular food source for many cultures worldwide. Even though fishers collect millions of bigfin reef squids each year, their population shows no signs of decline. Still, the IUCN lists the bigfin reef squid as a Data Deficient species, as not enough information exists at this time to determine its conservation status.",

    "Name": "Kokanee Salmon",
    "Fun_Fact": "They change color in preparation for spawning!",
    "Text": "The kokanee salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) is a non-anadromous type of sockeye salmon. Alternate names for this fish include kokanee trout, silver trout, Kennerly’s trout, Kennerly’s salmon, little redfish, kikanning, and Walla. Like other Pacific salmon, it only spawns once and then dies, limiting its lifespan to four or five years. It inhabits land-locked freshwater lakes in the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan. The scientific name for kokanee salmon is Oncorhynchus nerka . The name is a mixture of Greek and Russian. Oncorhynchus derives from the Greek terms for “nail” and “snout” while nerka is the Russian word for anadromous sockeye salmon. Kokanee salmon are a type of sockeye that are non-anadromous, or land-locked. Unlike this species, most sockeye are migratory, moving upriver from the ocean to spawn. Kokanee comes from the Sinixt word kekeni , an Indigenous term for the land-locked form of sockeye. The species belongs to the class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) within the superclass Osteichthyes (bony fishes). Scientists further place it in the order Salmoniformes and the family Salmonidae, which contains 11 genera and 66 species of salmon. Sockeye, including kokanee, belong to the genus Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmon and trout) . Prior to spawning, kokanee salmon have steel blue to bluish-green heads and backs, silver sides, and silvery-white bellies. Unlike most other salmon and trout, they do not have dark spots on their backs, though they may have speckles on their dorsal fins. During spawning, males develop a hump and a hooked jaw with teeth (a “kype”). They also turn bright red with dark green heads and black snouts and jaws. Females undergo a similar change, though their colors are duller. The color change is a result of a diet rich in carotenoids, which are pigments responsible for bright red, orange, and yellow coloration in animals and plants. The bright red attracts potential mates, but it also makes these fish more vulnerable to predators. These land-locked fish are typically smaller than anadromous sockeye. This is likely due to a less robust food supply in lakes and rivers as opposed to marine environments. While sockeye can grow up to 33 inches long and weigh as much as 17 pounds, kokanee salmon usually measure no more than 12-15 inches. They can weigh between three to five pounds, though most individuals don’t exceed one pound. However, the largest kokanee on record according to the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) measured 27 inches in length and weighed an impressive 9.67 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This species has fine scales that arrange themselves in rings, which (much like the rings of a tree) can help determine an individual’s age. It also has six types of fins with eight individual fins in total: a dorsal fin, an adipose fin, a caudal fin, an anal fin, two pelvic fins, and two pectoral fins. Kokanee salmon inhabit land-locked areas of the United States, Canada, Russia , and Japan. Within the United States, they occur in a number of states including Alaska , Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Idaho, New York, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, New England, North Carolina, and Utah. In Canada, they inhabit British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon Territory. These fish spend their whole lives in cool lakes, typically swimming at depths of 15-90 feet, though some go deeper than this. At spawning time, they move closer to the shore or upstream into tributaries. The IUCN has not assessed the conservation status of kokanee salmon as of 2022. As of 2010, it lists sockeye salmon as Least Concern due to its stable populations. However, NOAA Fisheries lists sockeye populations in Lake Ozette (Washington) and Snake River (Idaho) as protected under the Endangered Species Act. The WWF warns of potential threats to other Pacific salmon species including climate change, poaching, habitat destruction, river blockages, and overharvesting. You can find a list of endangered species here . The ancient ancestors of kokanee salmon lived as far back as 65-95 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period. During this time, they underwent a significant autotetraploid event in which they developed twice the number of chromosome arms and DNA content. Scientists speculate that this resulted in greater diversity and faster evolution. By the early Miocene Epoch, approximately 15-20 million years ago, two genera within Salmonidae split from each other. The first genus, Salmo , comprises Atlantic salmon ; the other, Oncorhynchus , contains Pacific salmon. Oncorhynchus speciated throughout the Miocene, producing all extant species by six million years ago. Although fossils of Pacific salmon from the ensuing Pleistocene are rare, scientists speculate that northwestern North America’s active geologic history inspired greater diversity among Oncorhynchus than Salmo . It is possible that kokanee salmon came from lake-type sockeye rather than sea-type sockeye. The lake-type may have become land-locked at some point and evolved into its current non-anadromous form. Taxonomists currently debate whether or not kokanee and sockeye salmon belong to two different species. Though they often inhabit the same habitats during spawning season, the two types do not automatically mate with each other. Interestingly, one study in Skaha Lake, British Columbia introduced a sockeye population to a kokanee population and observed the hybrid spawn. It discovered that 92% of hybrid individuals were non-anadromous with 76% being the offspring of resident non-anadromous females. Some sockeye offspring have been known to become non-anadromous while some kokanee offspring have become anadromous. A unique subtype of kokanee, black kokanee , exists in Lake Saiko in Japan and the Anderson and Seton lakes in British Columbia. Some scientists consider the Japanese type to be its own species, Oncorhynchus kawamurae . These isolated populations on either side of the Pacific exhibit black nuptial coloration and spawn much deeper than most sockeye salmon, anywhere between 65-230 feet below the surface. The lack of shared mtDNA haplotypes or a monophyletic grouping suggests that the Japanese populations likely split from the Anderson-Seton populations during two different evolutionary episodes. This may correspond to the multiple proposed postglacial splits of regular kokanee from sockeye. Kokanee salmon are omnivores, though they prefer animal matter to plant matter. Because of their small size, they are restricted to diminutive prey and are themselves easy targets for a number of predators. Kokanee salmon eat zooplankton, aquatic insects, freshwater shrimp, and small plants. Since zooplankton are so tiny, these fish use comb-like gill rakers on their gills to separate miniscule organisms from the water. Chinook salmon are the primary predators of kokanee salmon along with other large fish like rainbow trout, char, sturgeon , and burbot. They are also the targets of bears, wolves, otters, osprey and bald eagles , not to mention humans. The risk increases dramatically during spawning season when both males and females turn a conspicuous red. Unlike sockeye, kokanee salmon do not migrate from the rivers of their birth to the ocean. Instead, they move to nearby lakes, where they spend four to five years growing and maturing. After this, they reach sexual maturity and are ready to spawn either in the lake shallows or upstream in tributaries. Like all Pacific salmon, they are semelparous, dying soon after spawning. Because of their mating habits, these fish live only four to five years. Typically in their fourth year, males and females make their way to the site of their birth during a period of time called a “run.” Runs occur between August and December depending on the location. The female digs a trench, or a “redd.” Other, subordinate males may be in attendance, though the dominant male will fight them off using his kype and hump. The female may also be aggressive toward them as well as other females. Once ready, the female and dominant male descend together into the redd. They gape and vibrate until they release eggs and milt (sperm). One female typically lays approximately 1,000 eggs, though she may lay more or less depending on the availability of food sources. The other males may also release their milt on her other side. The female covers the fertilized eggs as she digs a new redd just upstream in preparation to spawn again. Both males and females may mate with multiple partners. The eggs incubate for approximately 110 days, usually hatching in February or March. Newly-hatched alevins depend on attached egg-yolk sacs for nutrition for the first two to three weeks of life. Once they develop into fry and then juveniles, they move downstream to a nearby lake or into deeper waters to feed and grow. Kokanee salmon are popular recreational or sport fish, though other sockeye salmon are important to commercial fisheries. NOAA estimates the 2021 worldwide commercial catch for sockeye salmon at 272 million pounds with a total value of $459 million. The vast majority of sockeye comes from Alaska, though fisheries net smaller numbers off the West Coast, mainly around Washington and Oregon. Though they are great for canning, these fish are also good fresh or frozen. For this species, fisheries typically use gillnet purse seines or reef nets. Though kokanee salmon are small, they are aggressive and fight hard to free themselves, making them valuable to recreational and sport anglers. These fish travel in schools, making it possible to catch multiple fish in one session. They are active during the day but are likeliest to bite at dawn and dusk when the light is low. The best types of bait are pink maggots, dye-cured shrimp, or canned corn, though anglers should be careful not to overload their hooks. One or two pieces of bait per hook should be sufficient. Kokanee salmon flesh is soft, rich, and vibrantly red with a pleasant, relatively mild taste. Acceptable ways to cook kokanee salmon include grilling, roasting, frying, smoking, and baking. Check out this comprehensive guide to smoked kokanee or explore a number of methods for preparing this delectable fish. This recipe for herbed kokanee with roasted garlic and lemon butter is a great way to get started. This fish yields relatively lean meat much like that of sockeye flesh .

    "Name": "Onager",
    "Fun_Fact": "An onager's coat changes color with the season.",
    "Text": "An onager’s coat changes color with the season. If you are a keen reader of historic texts and literature, you might have come across the mention of the onager. Previously used as beasts of burden, onagers were once domesticated, but now, they live in the wild. They bear a remarkable resemblance to donkeys, and it would take a trained eye to tell them apart. Two subspecies of the onager are extinct and the species is near threatened. Onager is a name that comes from the Greek words onos meaning “ donkey ” and agrios meaning “wild.” Scientifically, the onager is known as Equus hemionus. The generic name Equus is Latin for “horse” while the specific name is a compound word derived from Greek hemi and onos meaning “half donkey.” Onagers are also called hemiones or the Asiatic wild ass. Members of the genus Equus are odd-toed ungulates, which refers to animals with hoofs, and they have oval-shaped hoofs. Other animals that belong to this genus are horses and zebras. The onager consists of five subspecies with the Mongolian wild ass as the nominate subspecies. The European wild ass and the Syrian wild ass are both extinct subspecies. The name Onager is commonly used only for the Persian onager whose subspecific name is onager, but it is actually the name of the entire species. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Onagers belong to the genus Equus which houses every living equine. The oldest known equine fossil found in Idaho comes from Equus simplicidens and is described as resembling a zebra but with the head structure of a donkey. Onagers have existed for over four million years, being among the oldest Equus species to diverge from their most recent common ancestor followed by the African zebra. Many ancient literary works mention onagers. They were domesticated thousands of years ago and originally used as beasts of burden. However, human beings never managed to completely tame these wild creatures and so they were replaced by the horse , donkey , and mule . Onagers are a species of wild asses. They have a short mane, large ears, and pale hair that changes color depending on the season. In the summer, they become reddish-brown, and this changes to yellowish or grayish-brown in the winter. The onager’s winter coat gets longer and coarser as well. Commonly misidentified with donkeys , onagers are much larger than donkeys. They weigh up to 440 to 640 pounds and are 6.9 to 8.2 feet in length and 4.9 feet at the shoulder. Also, onagers look more horse-like than donkeys. Another distinguishing feature between donkeys and onagers is a black stripe with a white border that runs down the middle of the onager’s back. Onagers have white rumps, bellies, and muzzles. Onagers are crepuscular animals with activity levels peaking during dusk and early in the morning at dawn when the weather is cooler and lowering when the sun is out. Although onagers can get their required daily amount of water from their food alone, they prefer to live near a reliable water source. This comes in handy, especially for lactating mothers who need a consistent supply of water. Onagers are a migrating species and make large migratory hikes that cover up to 15 square miles annually. Onagers are also very social animals that practice polygamy. They live in groups of about 10 to 12 members. The group usually includes a male onager (jack), a group of females (jennets), and their offspring. Onagers tend to form much bigger groups during fall and winter when and where resources are abundant and this herd can swell to sizes of 300 to 1,200 individuals. This herd is not uniform and is made up of several autonomous groups that break off after a short while in the herd. Older jacks are usually solitary. When threatened by a predator, onagers defend themselves as most equids do and work together to kick powerfully at their assailant and chase them away. When it comes to their relationship with people, this species is infamously difficult to tame. They are quite a stubborn species. Onagers are herbivorous and folivorous animals. Their diet consists primarily of perennial grasses, and they also forage for herbs, fruit, leaves, and, in more arid climes, trees and shrubs. They are also known to feed on tree bark. Onagers tend to live very close to water bodies. When water is lacking, they dig holes into dry riverbeds to reach water near the surface. In the colder months, onagers have been seen eating snow as a source of water. They get their required liquid intake from the food they consume. Onagers live in arid, temperate, and cold regions of Asian countries including China , Iran , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , India , Mongolia, and Israel . These equids inhabit grasslands , shrublands, desert plains, oases, steppes, mountain steppes, and the savanna. The onager subspecies prefer to reside in different habitats. You can find this Mongolian wild ass in the deserts and grasslands of Mongolia and northern China. They are the most widespread onager subspecies, but their population is dwindling due to poaching and habitat loss. They are extinct now in Kazakhstan and some regions in China and Siberia . As its name suggests, the Indian wild ass inhabited the arid regions and desert steppes of northwest India and Pakistan . However, now, 4,500 individuals are located in Gujarat, living in wildlife sanctuaries. The Turkmenian kulan prefers to live in cold and hot deserts. You can find this subspecies in Turkmenistan and returning to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan through reintroduction. The rare Persian onager likes to reside in desert and semidesert regions of Turkmenistan and northeastern Iran. This subspecies was decimated by the loss of habitat, resource competition with domestic livestock, and poaching. About 600 to 700 government-protected Persian onagers are left in the wild and less than 100 in captivity worldwide. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species , the Persian onager is an endangered species with only about 790 individuals in total remaining. The onager species is Near Threatened on the protection list with only about 28,000 onagers worldwide. The onager species is currently extinct in Jordan , Syria, some parts of Siberia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Palestine. Onagers reach sexual maturity at two years old but they don’t typically start mating until they reach three to four years of age. These animals practice polygyny, where one male mates with multiple females in one season. They do this in two main ways. Firstly, dominant onager males typically guard territories that are abundant in resources such as food and water. Then, the females wander between these guarded areas to mate with them. In the other mating method, a dominant male mates with the females in his harem and breeds with them. Mating season takes place from April through to September, peaking in the summer months of June and July. Gestation usually lasts 11 months and the female onager gives birth for a bit over ten minutes to usually one foal. Onager foals are precocious and can stand up with little to no help and nurse just 15 to 20 minutes after given birth to. These foals reach full independent age at one to two years of age. Onagers can live a plentiful life of 14 years in the wild and up to 26 years in captivity. Equids such as onagers usually have a long list of natural predators that hunt them. The onagers in Iran are prey to Persian leopards and striped hyenas . In India, mugger crocodiles are on the hunt for migratory onagers. Asiatic lions , tigers , Asiatic cheetahs , and bears also prey on them. Presently, gray wolves are the primary predator of onagers. Apart from predation, onagers also face the following threats: The onager is a protected species in most of the countries it inhabits and many breeding programs have been set up to ensure that the onager has a future. It is currently being reintroduced to some of its native territories.",

Once considered vermin and hunted to near extinction, the European polecat now enjoys a healthy population in most of its former range. The European polecat’s scientific name is Mustela putorius . The name polecat comes from the French term “poule chat,” which means “chicken cat.” The term refers to the fact that polecats would sometimes raid chicken coops for eggs and chicks. The polecat has a slender body, short legs, and a wide head. Small ears, a round nose, and bright eyes give this little guy an adorable look, but don’t be fooled. The polecat is a fierce fighter who will defend itself aggressively. The polecat has thick, glossy fur. Its colors are mostly deep brown to black with red patches and a yellow underbelly. It usually has a white patch around its nose and a raccoon-like mask around its eyes. One chief way to make the identification of a polecat is the way its fur changes. In summer, the fur gets lighter and thinner. In winter, the polecat’s coat gets thicker and shades to a silvery gray color. Compared to other members of the mustelid family, the polecat has exceptionally large, sharp teeth. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The European polecat is a solitary, nocturnal hunter. Some female polecats and young polecats may look for food in the daytime, but adults and males prefer to hunt at night. The polecat sets up a range of territory that it uses as a hunting ground. The size of this personal habitat can range from a small plot of land to a large spread that includes several dens. Some polecats use the abandoned dens of foxes and badgers instead of building their own. Despite this, the polecat is not strongly territorial. A polecat will often share its territory with other polecats, and it usually doesn’t mark its habitat with scent. A polecat is a quiet animal with few vocalizations. It may growl or squeak when frightened. The European polecat prefers to live near water sources. It can often be found near marshes, riverbanks, dunes, and coastal cliffs. Being close to water increases its food supply. Polecats are adaptable animals that can be found in wetlands , grasslands , agricultural land, prairies, and forests. European polecats use hedgerows for shelter and navigation. They also prefer to use existing nests rather than build their own. The polecat is a carnivore that eats voles , mice , and other rodents . It also eats lizards , frogs , and birds . If it can’t find its preferred prey, a polecat may supplement its diet with fruit and insects . A polecat’s diet can vary greatly. It changes according to what is available and the time of year. Scientists have seen European polecats eating the following: Despite its small size, the polecat can defend itself from larger predators. It uses its anal glands to produce a strong, unpleasant smell that wards off many predators. Large carnivores usually leave polecats alone for that reason. Most polecats are killed by cars. Other threats are habitat loss, especially hedge removal when forests are cleared. Polecats are sometimes trapped accidentally or poisoned by preying on rodents who have eaten poisons. The polecat’s breeding season is in winter. Polecats are polygamous, and both males and females reproduce with several mates. They reach sexual maturity when they’re a year old. There is no courtship or mating ritual. A male grabs a female by the neck and copulates with her. Male polecats are known as hobs, and females are known as jills. A pregnant female incubates the babies for 42 days and then gives birth to a litter of three to seven kits. The mothers feed and care for the kits until they are about 3 months old. Mother polecats are extremely protective of their young and will defend them aggressively against intruders. European polecats have a lifespan of six to 14 years in the wild. Their lifespan in captivity may be longer. Because of its extensive range of distribution, exact population numbers are unknown, but conservationists are concerned that the polecat’s population is decreasing. The European polecat is listed as “least concern” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) . It enjoys protected status in the United Kingdom . In the past century, polecats were considered vermin and were routinely killed by gamekeepers and farmers. That led to the near extinction of this species. Today, polecats have recovered their population numbers. Many people now appreciate their help in controlling rat populations. In the United Kingdom, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act and are a priority species under the U.K. Biodiversity Framework. The European polecat was once hunted as vermin. Today, farmers and gamekeepers appreciate the polecat’s help in controlling rodent populations. This masked bandit has recovered from the brink of extinction and now has a stable population.",

    "Name": "Anole Lizard",
    "Fun_Fact": "There are just under 400 species, several of which change color.",
    "Text": "The name Anole Lizard refers to one of over 400 species of mostly color-changing lizards located primarily in South and Central America. One of the most charming residents of the North American garden is the little green anole lizard. Curious and occasionally friendly, these bright green reptiles can be seen darting across deck rails and rearing their heads above flower pots. They hunt for moths among begonias and take flies for a snack with lightning-quick precision. There is a single species, the Green Anole, Anolis carolinensis , native to North America , which is sometimes called the American Chameleon. Though many anole lizards can exhibit color adaptations to their environment, the anole lizard differs from true Chameleons in many ways, not least in their very limited ability for color change. In most species, the male and female differ, most commonly because the males have a brightly colored dewlap on the necks, but males and females may also be characterized by size and sometimes nose length. Another species, the Brown Anole ( A. sagrei ), can be found in parts of the United States , but is considered an invasive species and has a negative effect on local ecosystems. A few other species, including the Knight Anole ( A. equestris ) are also found in Florida but are introduced species and not native to the area. Anoles come from the family Dactyloidae under the Class Reptilia. Because there are over 400 species, it would be impossible to list all their scientific names here. Collectively, they are called Anolis. Some of the subspecies are: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The size and color of each anole lizard species will differ depending on habitat, climate, and diet. Depending on where they live and how they hunt, they may have physical adaptations such as large hind legs for jumping large distances for prey, or short stubby legs if they live higher up in trees and creep up slowly on prey to avoid detection by their predators when hunting. They come in many colors, though the most common colors are a range of greens and browns, with yellow and sometimes blue variations. Most male anole lizards have a dewlap, which is a piece of erectile tissue on the neck, which can be collapsed and extended into a semi-oval shape. The dewlaps of the male can be almost any color, and usually, the color differs greatly from the lizard’s body. Anoles are mostly solitary. They may live near each other but are not generally found in groups. Males aggressively defend their territory during sexual maturity, otherwise, they are typically docile and tolerate humans to varying degrees. Various behavioral adaptations occur depending on the environment in which they live. Ancestors of the green anole lizard hail from Cuba, and long ago spread across the southeastern United States. These little green lizards are now sold in pet stores and have recently become the subjects of several evolutionary scientific studies. The evolution of animal species is often portrayed as a process that takes place over thousands of years – and that is often the case. But sometimes, as they say, needs must. The North American green anole offers an example of evolution at warp speed. It was a case of evolve or die. The green anole lizard is the only anole species native to the United States, and for most of their history, they have lived on or around the base of trees where insects abound. Someone brought brown anoles into the country in the 1950s, and those highly invasive lizards quickly began to drive the green anoles from the forest floor to higher branches. Rather than die out, the green anoles forged a new life in the trees and on higher ground. They became expert climbers and found new places to hunt. Amazingly, over a span of a mere 20 generations and 15 years, the green anoles evolved larger toe pads covered with more sticky scales to make climbing easier. According to scientists, this is a perfect example of “character displacement,” an evolutionary process that allows two closely related species to diverge and take advantage of separate niches. Other studies have proven that the resilient little lizards have evolved to tolerate colder temperatures after surviving extreme cold snaps in some states – while city anoles evolved stickier feet to make climbing up buildings easier. As a species, green anoles have learned to go with the flow to survive. Most anole lizard species live in or near trees, though some live near the base and some prefer the smaller limbs near the top. Their hunting styles will differ depending on their locations. Anole lizards may be found in bushes, reeds, low limbs, tree trunks, and forest canopies. They are found in many ecosystems, including on farms, in residential yards, in rainforests, dry forests, arid scrub, grasslands, and in riverside vegetation. Almost all anoles are insectivores, though some will also consume some vegetation and nectar. Anoles are hunters who feed primarily on insects , spiders, and other invertebrates , but may also consume nectar, tree sap, and occasionally rotted fruit. Larger species may consume smaller or baby lizards, snakes , and eggs. One threat to anoles is other anoles. For instance, when they share a habitat, Brown Anoles will eat Green Anoles and their eggs. They are also prey for larger reptiles and snakes, as well as many predatory birds and a few small mammals . Their color-changing abilities afford them some protection from predators, but they are vulnerable during mating when they increase their movements and show off brighter colors. Typically, when males reach sexual maturity, they will hunt for a mate by flexing their dewlap and sometimes doing what looks like push-ups. These pushups are also used as a show of strength to discourage other males from entering the mating territory. Both males and females are polyamorous, mating with multiple partners over their lifespans. Male anoles defend a singular territory so that they can have exclusive access to females that enter into or live within that territory. However, the females wander outside the territories and mate with other males also. When a mate is found, the female will lay one or two eggs after copulation, often every day through the mating season. A baby will hatch at about 0.75 inches in size. A baby anole will reach sexual maturity at about 18 months and have a lifespan of two (wild) to seven years (captive). Populations vary widely between species with Green Anoles being estimated at around 100,000 specimens or more and the Blue Anole so rare that it may be headed for extinction.",

    "Name": "Dwarf Boa",
    "Fun_Fact": "Some species can change color from dark to light, and back again.",
    "Text": "Dwarf boas can be a fantastic option for those who want a snake, but not a behemoth. Boa species range from truly tiny to gargantuan, and some of the most beautiful species are gentle and calm, making them great pets – if you have the space. However, many of us don’t have enough space or the desire to have a buddy help us handle our 14-foot pet boa. Meet the dwarf boas. They can be of a naturally occurring smaller locality of Boa imperator , one of the Tropidophiidae dwarf boas, or a species that was bred to be smaller for owners who want the boa experience without the bulk. Boas, which are nonvenomous constrictor snakes, can be encountered in tropical regions of Central and South America. Similar to their anaconda relatives, they possess exceptional swimming abilities. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . However, they tend to favor terrestrial habitats and predominantly reside in hollow logs and deserted burrows previously occupied by mammals. The dwarf boa is a member of the Tropidophiidae family and inhabits the elevated cloud forests in northeastern Ecuador. This species stands out due to its possession of a “vestigial pelvis,” a feature commonly observed in primitive snakes. Some experts interpret this characteristic as evidence supporting the theory that snakes evolved from lizards that gradually lost their limbs over an extensive span of time. Those dwarf boas that were bred down in size are fairly easy to find from breeders. They tend towards the expensive end of the hobby, as they were specially bred for size, but they’re excellent choices for those who want a big snake that won’t get too big. Naturally occurring dwarf boas, such as those found in the Tarahumara region of Mexico, the Islands near Panama, and other areas. Some are being captive-bred in the U.S., so finding one of these for your next snake pet is possible without taking one from the wild. Often, these snakes live in areas where small sizes were rewarded by nature. It’s usually caused by limited prey and a lack of appropriate cover. The Boa look-alikes from the Tropidophis genus aren’t as readily available. Plus, given that many are endangered or threatened in nature, their focus should be on preserving those species. They also tend to be more delicate than their larger dwarf cousins. These snakes generally inhabit areas of South America and the West Indies; most species spend their day either hidden under vegetation or burrowed underground. They only surface at night and when it rains. A few arboreal species hide in the bromeliads that grow on trees. Dwarf boas aren’t one species of snake, they’re a class of boas and boa-like snakes that stay smaller than you expect from a boa. There are types of dwarf boas, we list a few here: This is what many people mean when they’re talking about dwarf boas. These are true boas that stay small because of the ecological niche that they inhabit in the wild. Corn Island boas, Caulkers Cay, Crawl Cay, Belize Mainland, and Hog Island boas are all subgroups of Boa Imperator . They aren’t generally considered subspecies, although some could possibly qualify. This species typically grows much larger – sometimes as long as 14 feet. However, because the prey is scarce, or the hiding spaces are small, only the small survive in their environment. Sometimes, when brought into a pet situation, a dwarf locality gets much bigger than expected. Why? Well, when you have a growing reptile that’s been accustomed to a particular amount of food, its body adjusts to that. It grows to fit its environment. Now, remove it from that environment and give it more food and better habitat. It’s going to get bigger than it would have in its native habitat, which makes the husbandry of these dwarf boas more challenging than that of other boas. These snakes happened to carry a dwarfism gene that a breeder decided to explore. They’ve become popular because they naturally stay much smaller than their “standard” cousins (and even some of the dwarf locality boas). These snakes typically only reach about 4-6 feet and look like a smaller version of the regular B. imperator or B. constrictor. At one point, this family was included in the Boidae family because they look like boas, but newer research indicated they are more closely related to false coral snakes than boas. So, out of the Boidae, and into Tropidophidiiae they went. There are two genera in this family and 19 species between them. They’re very secretive and difficult to observe. A few are in zoos but because they’re not as flashy as say, a rainbow boa or an anaconda these little guys just don’t get the public play that the true boas get. Many Tropidophis genus snakes have been assessed by IUCN and found to be Vulnerable or Endangered, but a few are classified as Least Concerns. One or two haven’t been seen in over 100 years and are assumed extinct. The highly secretive nature of the genus makes them exceedingly difficult to study. The dwarf boas bred deliberately by breeders aren’t out in nature, so there’s no assessment available. These snakes are strictly pet-trade animals, and that’s a beautiful thing – it allows snake lovers to have a boa in a small package and doesn’t deplete the wild population. The locality dwarfs, though – now there’s a good question. You could think of localities as nature’s version of a morph because they’re shaped by their environment. At this point, most locality boas have either been studied or are being studied and conservation is helping their population, like the Hog Island Boa. IUCN doesn’t list any of them as separate species from Boa constrictor , but some localities are endangered because of pet trade exportation and habitat destruction. There are a couple of locality dwarf boas from the Solomon Islands, they belong to the Candoia genus. These snakes are pretty stocky and spend a lot of time on the ground; they’re bred in captivity, but quite expensive when you find them. Because of the wide variety of dwarf boas both available as pets and out in the wild, the descriptions vary significantly. Even dwarf boas tend towards being heavy-bodied and muscular. However, due to their overall size, they’ll be a bit thinner than typical boa constrictors. Some species change color from night to day, becoming darker and lighter. These snakes are nonvenomous constrictors that grab prey with rear-pointing teeth and squeeze until the prey’s heart stops. Then, they swallow it whole. The Tropidophis genus dwarf boas are much more slender and fragile. Many of them change color depending on the time of day, and can even bleed voluntarily from the eyes, nostrils, and mouths when threatened. A dwarf boa isn’t as difficult or dangerous to handle as a full-size red-tailed boa because it’s small. Its teeth may make you bleed, but otherwise, you won’t suffer any ill effects from a bite. The wonderful part of any of the dwarf boa species is that they are small enough to handle relatively easily, they move slowly enough that you’re not going to be chasing it off across the yard, and they’re nonvenomous. Dwarf boas are relatively easy to handle. They’re not aggressive snakes, but some boas can be more prone to biting than other snake species. Like many animals, each snake has a different personality; they even have different moods. Dwarf locality boas from the Boa and Candoia genera make pretty good pets – if you are willing to take the time and money required to create a great habitat for them, proper feeding amounts, and learn to read their moods.",

    "Name": "Rock Bass",
    "Fun_Fact": "Rock bass can change their color slightly to camouflage.",
    "Text": "The rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) also known as the black or rock perch , is a type of freshwater fish that belongs to the sunfish family. It’s a medium-sized fish native to the lakes and ponds in North America, popular with anglers for fishing purposes. They are generally smaller than smallmouth bass and have a distinctive appearance, making them distinguishable amongst other popular angler fish. Rock bass belongs to the Centrarchidae family in the Ambloplites genus. The binomial or scientific name for rock bass is Ambloplites rupestris . Rock bass is easy to identify when you know what to look for. These fish have a characteristically large mouth set underneath their eyes, which are a deep red coloration. These fish are not very large compared to other types of bass, only growing around 6-10 inches in length. They can weigh up to 3 pounds, but one pound is common in smaller specimens. Their color is quite interesting, and these fish have predominantly yellowish-brown bodies with silver and black. Shades of black are seen throughout the tips of their anal fins, and black dotted striped line their body horizontally. A black dot is located near the fish’s gill plates. The dorsal fin is spiny and lacks a uniform shape. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Even though rock bass is part of the sunfish family, they do not have a flat body. Their body has a less compressed body that looks similar to a bluegill and largemouth bass. It is not uncommon for this fish to be misidentified as warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), but instead of having three spines on their anal fin, rock bass has around six instead. This fish relies on their body coloration for camouflage purposes, which enables them to change its color to black or silver to match its environment. This can make it difficult to identify them if they are changing their color. This type of camouflage helps to protect them from predators, but it can also change with age and stress. Rock bass is native to east-central North America, but they have been introduced into Atlantic river drainages. They are distributed throughout southeastern Canada from Ontario to Quebec, toward the Mississippi River Basin, and all the way to Missouri and Arkansas. This fish is plentiful in most parts of the Dakota river in the U.S. and the Great Lakes region along with Torch and Champlain lake. They have also entered the Savannah River basin and eastern parts of the U.S., such as New York, Tennessee, and Kentucky. You can also find rock bass in the southern parts of Florida, Alabama, and parts of Georgia in the Chattahoochee River basin. The population of rock bass is considered the “least concern” on the IUCN red list. They are not considered an invasive species. Fishing for rock bass as a sport is managed by some rules and regulations, and artificial water systems are used to manage and maintain populations of rock bass. This is a freshwater fish that inhabit various bodies of water. This includes lakes, river systems, reservoirs, shore banks, ponds, weed beds, streams, and spring holes. These fish prefer cooler waters with plenty of rocks, hence their name “rock bass.” The water should ideally be rich in vegetation and covered with a rocky bottom. The water should ideally have low turbidity, so rocks, wooden branches, and vegetation should be plentiful as hiding places. The bottom of the water system should be filled with rocks or sand. These fish do not typically inhabit waters with silt. Their ideal current is slow-moving, and they avoid river areas with fast-moving currents. The main predators of young rock bass include northern pike, larger bass species, muskies, and walleye. Adult rock bass is generally more protected when they have a larger size. They are carnivorous fish that prey on smaller fish. In some cases, they may eat their own fry if there is insufficient vegetation and rocks to keep the fry safe. The main times that adults can be seen preying on food items are during the early mornings and evenings, and they are diurnal. They will eat a variety of smaller fish, including minnows, amphibians, zooplankton, and yellow merch, along with small crustaceans and insects and their larvae. They will also readily eat a variety of baitfish from the surface. The average lifespan for rock bass is between 8-10 years in the wild. Certain specimens can live longer, but it is uncommon for rock bass to live for more than 12 years. They can reproduce once sexually mature at 2-3 years old. They are polyandrous, which means that they mate with multiple fish during the spawning season. Females can lay more than 5,000 eggs during a single spawn, which occurs around April till the beginning of June in warmer water. Spawning occurs around rock bass nests, typically created close to each other. Males are responsible for building the nest, and they can become quite territorial during this time in efforts to protect the nest. Once spawning has occurred, the male will fan the eggs and protect the fry shortly after hatching. Not all fry enter adulthood, as rock bass sometimes eat their young or are eaten by predators. Rock bass is considered to be game fish, and they are popular for fishing. This fish enjoys a variety of bait such as wax worms, nightcrawlers, minnows, and other types of baitfish. The best way to catch one is to use artificial lures or live bait. A micro fishing rod and a fishing reel with a smooth drag are a good choice for catching them. These fish do not spend much time in the middle of the lake and prefer to school around the bank or shoreline of the water in vegetation and structures where they feel secure. They can be used in cooking, and they are edible. These fish can be pan-fried or baked, but ensuring the internal temperature is right before consumption is important. The flesh of the bass is described as flaky and white.",

    "Text": "Native to South America, keyhole cichlids are freshwater fish that live in slow-moving bodies of water covered in thick vegetation. They are primarily found in coastal streams, tributaries, and river basins. Venezuela’s lower Orinoco basin is home to where many of the keyhole cichlids live. Scientifically known as Cleithracara maronii , the Keyhole cichlid belongs to the family Cichlidae . Their name originates from the distinctive keyhole pattern on their body. The most distinctive feature of this fish is the black keyhole mark on its upper flank. This secondary marking is located on the fish’s face, which displays a black vertical line that extends across the head and passes through the eye. Their body consists of yellow-cream colored scales; however, different keyhole fish species have different fin colors. Additionally, with age, keyhole cichlids’ coloring lightens. The dorsal and anal fins of keyhole cichlids are long and slender. They differ from other cichlid species by having rounded foreheads and oval-shaped bodies. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The species of this fish is found in Central and South America. It has a wide distribution, ranging from the Atlantic coast of Panama to the Amazon River basin in Brazil. It is a freshwater fish that inhabits slow-moving rivers, streams, and lakes. The population of the keyhole cichlid fish is considered stable; unfortunately, it’s threatened by habitat destruction and pollution. This fish species prefers to live in shallow, murky waters in areas with plenty of vegetation. It is a carnivore that feeds on insects, crustaceans , and small fish. In the wild, the keyhole cichlid predators include larger fish, such as the piranha and birds of prey. Other potential predators include snakes, caimans, and other aquatic animals. In addition, the keyhole cichlid is also preyed upon by other fish, such as the oscar and the discus. To protect itself against certain predators, the keyhole cichlid will hide in rocks and crevices and use its bright colors to blend in with its surroundings. These fish reproduce by laying eggs on a flat rock or a hard surface . The male is responsible for providing a suitable location so the female can lay her eggs. The female will lay up to 500 eggs, which the male guards until these eggs hatch. During this time, the male will fan the eggs with his fins to keep these eggs oxygenated and free of debris. The eggs will then hatch within a few days, and both parents will take care of the young fish (now called fry) until they can swim and look for food. After this stage, the male will no longer guard the fry, and the female will take over caring for them. The lifespan of the keyhole cichlid is usually between 5-10 years. However, they are a hardy species and can live longer with proper care. This sought-after fish is known to put up a good fight, so it is essential to use the correct tools and bait to catch these intelligent fish. The keyhole cichlid has a taste for white bread, worms, shrimp, and minnows ; use these ingredients as bait. And, of course, invest in a hardy spinning reel, as these fish come with great force. Fishing the keyhole cichlid is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and experience the thrill of the catch. This colorful fish is a popular choice for freshwater anglers and can be found in many parts of the world. As for cooking this tasty fish, it’s a great staple to a delicious meal. This fish is an excellent option for those looking for a unique flavor and texture. Not only is it a healthy choice, but it is also easy to prepare. With just a few simple ingredients such as prawns, spinach, peas, garlic, juice of an orange, and spirulina powder, you can create a flavorful dish that will be sure to please. If you are looking for something new and exciting, add this fish to your culinary repertoire. The population of this fish found in the wild is stable, as It is not considered to be threatened or endangered. Furthermore, this popular aquarium fish is a peaceful species well-suited to a community tank, making these fish a popular choice for aquarists.",

    "Name": "Golden Tortoise Beetle",
    "Fun_Fact": "Golden tortoise beetles have a metallic gold color which can change to dull brown when disturbed.",
    "Text": "The golden tortoise beetle is a species of insect in the leaf beetle family, known for its striking gold color. They have rounded, domed bodies, similar to that of ladybugs . This beetle has a unique ability to change the shade of its pigmentation from bright to dull gold using microscopic cavities in its cuticle. When threatened, the beetle presses its body close to the leaf surface, then tucks its appendages underneath its body like a tortoise . Golden tortoise beetles are herbivores, feeding on plants in the Convolvulaceae family. The golden tortoise beetle is an insect species in the leaf beetle family (Chrysomelidae). This group consists of more than 37,000 species of fully herbivorous beetles grouped into 2500 genera. This makes them one of the most commonly encountered beetles. This beetle is sometimes referred to as goldbug. The golden tortoise beetle species – Charidotella sexpunctata – contains one subspecies, Charidotella bicolor . Both are considered golden tortoise beetles. They’re native to the Americas and are mostly found in the United States , Canada , and Mexico . The goldbug is one of the few bugs in the world with a fully gold-colored body. They belong to a subfamily of insects known as tortoise beetles. This group of beetles is characterized by a wing covering (elytra) that extends to the side of their body, long enough to cover their legs, hence the name tortoise beetle. Goldbugs have round and domed bodies. They are similar to lady beetles in shape and size. Of course, they differ significantly from ladybugs in color and behavior. Like other tortoise beetles, adult golden beetles are characterized by expanded elytra that cover their head and appendages. The margins of the extended wing cover are not golden like the rest of their body. Instead, it is transparent and has a glass-like appearance. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These beetles are fairly small. They typically measure between 5 to 7 millimeters in length. Their most distinctive feature is their shiny, metallic gold color which earned them their common name and nickname, goldbug. Although they’re known for their bright golden color, golden tortoise beetles don’t always maintain this color. Their color changes as they grow, when they’re mating, or when they’re disturbed. Scientists are not certain of the mechanisms for this color change, but it is believed to be due to changes in the microscopic particles on their cuticles. Some theories also suggest that the color change is due to their ability to withdraw or introduce moisture to the surface of their exoskeleton. They can dull their bright metallic sheen, turning the lovely gold color to a brown or reddish brown. When the insect dies, the metallic gold color fades. The golden tortoise beetle is native to the Americas. They mostly live in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In places they live, they’re mostly found in association with plants in the family Convolvulaceae, their primary host. Adults emerge during the winter, but the beetles usually move to the host plant around spring. The field bindweed ( Convolvulus arvensis ) is typically their early season host. Later, they move to other plants, like the sweet potato and morning glories. Mostly found in fields and gardens, goldbugs rarely venture indoors. Many gardeners prefer to keep them around because of their striking appearance. Like all leaf beetles, golden tortoise beetles are fully herbivorous. They’re one of several tortoise beetles that feed on garden vines. Both adult and larvae forms of this insect feed on plants, leaving unsightly holes on the leaf surface. Plants in the Convolvulaceae family are their only food source. This includes morning glories, bindweed, and sweet potatoes. They do not form large swarms, and the damage they leave behind is mild. Most plants recover fully. Parasitic wasps of the genus Tetrastichus and the parasitoid fly, Eucelatoriopsis dimmocki , prey on goldbugs. Several ladybug species also prey on the larvae of this beetle. Damsel bugs, assassin bugs , shield bugs, and other insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts may prey on the larvae of golden tortoise beetles. Although the larvae carry a shield made from waste products and dead skin to deter prey, it is only effective against small predators. Golden tortoise beetles don’t occur as major infestations. Hence, they’re hardly a concern for gardeners; however, if you prefer to keep them away, you should keep your garden free from weeds and make sure you care for your plants properly. This will help prevent various pests, including goldbugs. Since they’re quite conspicuous, you can remove the beetles by hand. This is the easiest way to handle small infestations. You can also mix an organic spray using two tablespoons of neem oil , one tablespoon of dish soap, and a gallon of water. Spray this on your plants to get rid of small clusters of the beetles. Goldbugs have a lot of natural enemies. These include aldrich flies, burks, and several species of ladybugs, such as damsel bugs and assassin bugs. You can release them into your garden to get rid of the larvae of this beetle. Chemical insecticides should only be a final resort, if any of the organic control measures don’t work.",

    "Text": "The Lawnmower Blenny (also known as the Jeweled Rockskipper, algae blenny, or banded blenny) is a saltwater fish, primarily found in Australasia. It is not sought after as a commercial fish for food, but it is a popular addition to many fish tanks because of the changing color of its body. 1. The color of the Lawnmowner Blenny changes with its environment and mood. 2. It exclusively lives in shallow saltwater, consuming algae on the surface of rocks. 3. They only breed in the late spring and early summer months, due to the change in warmth. Originally discovered in 1786, the lawnmower blenny’s scientific name is Salarias fasciatus. While “Salarias” comes from the Latin word for trout , “fasciatus” means “banded.” They have many common names they go by, including the Jeweled Rockskipper, algae blenny, banded blenny, banded-jeweled blenny, barred blenny, lineated blenny, lined blenny, painted blenny, and sailfin blenny. The lawnmower blenny is in the order Blenniiformes, which includes 151 genera and almost 900 different species. The order includes many types of fish , though only six families are actually classified as “true” blennies. The family is Blenniidae. Part of the reason that the Lawnmower Blenny finds itself on the minds of pet owners is due to the changing color of its body. At no more than 3.7 to 4.2 inches in length, the color of the entire body can change to blend in with its surroundings, protecting it from predators. The intensity of these changing colors changes with their mood as well. To break up the color, it also features white spots along the body and darker lines towards the front. While the rest of the body can change, there are consistently blue spots that outline the back of their body. With no notch in the dorsal fin, these fish have smooth lips with tentacle-like cirri along their body. They have a rather fat belly, making them look almost comedic. The easiest place to find the saltwater blenny in nature is in Australasia, ranging from East Africa to the Islands of Micronesia. It prefers to live along shallow reef flats, allowing them to consistently graze on the algae on them. Their preferred water type is saltwater. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Though their actual population is unknown, they are considered Not Extinct , and no conservation efforts are being made currently. Since they are often kept as pets, they don’t need to be sourced from the wild to care for. Instead, breeders will sell them directly to pet stores. If you need to catch one of these fish in the tank to clean, using a net is the most you’ll need. According to the IUCN Redlist of endangered species , the lawnmower blenny is considered least concern . Unfortunately for the Lawnmower Blenny, this fish is primarily prey for other animals. Though they are technically considered to be an herbivore, they are more accurately referred to as detritivores, which means their diet consists of dead organic material. Their main food is algae. The Lawnmower Blenny is often consumed by fish larger than it is, like bluefish, weakfish, and striped bass. To protect itself from predators, it uses the changing color of its body to hide. It sometimes hides in oyster reefs, but it is a natural part of the bottom of the food chain. While Lawnmower Blenny doesn’t really have any prey that it goes after, it can become aggressive with other fish in its tank as it gets older. This aggression isn’t really noted in the wild because it has plenty of space to roam. Typically, the Lawnmower Blenny spawns in the late spring and early summer between April and June. The mating is set off by the increased temperature, which pet owners can replicate in their tank with enough dedication. If this environment is changed, it is possible to breed them at home with highly specific care, but it can be difficult for a novice. The tank must be raised to 78 degrees Fahrenheit and breeding often has to be moved to another tank. In the wild, however, they lay eggs in empty shells, allowing males to fertilize them. Once on the substrate of these shells, they will stay there until they hatch. The resulting young – larvae – will stay in shallow water and feed on plankton. According to researchers, there’s no particular age that the Lawnmower Blenny has to reach for sexual maturity. It doesn’t matter whether another female or male is around them. However, it takes The Lawnmower Blenny is a rather small fish, so it is not ordinarily fished as a delicacy. There’s no commercial demand for these fish to eat, but the pet trade is popular for him.",

    "Name": "Chameleon",
    "Text": "The chameleon, scientific name Chamaeleonidae, is a species of lizard known for their ability to change colors and degrees of brightness. There are over 160 species of chameleon spread across Madagascar, Spain, Africa, Asia, and Portugal. They have large eyes and curled tails, and some species can change the color of their skin to blend in with their surroundings as a defense mechanism from predators. These lizards can change their skin to pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, and turquoise. The scientific name for a chameleon is Chamaeleo, which is derived from the Greek word “chamai” meaning on the ground and “leōn” meaning lion. This genus of lizards contains over 160 species that are native to Africa, Madagascar, Southern Europe, and Asia. They are known for their ability to change colors with their environment, allowing them to blend in perfectly with trees or rocks. Furthermore, they can also move each eye independently of one another to have a larger field of vision. A chameleon is an incredible animal with a unique ability to change its colors and blend into its environment. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors depending on the species. Generally speaking, most chameleons have flattened bodies and long tails with five digits on each foot that are adapted for gripping branches or other surfaces. Their eyes can move independently of one another which helps them scan their surroundings more efficiently. Chameleons also possess a protruding tongue which they use to capture prey such as insects or small lizards. On average, they range in size from 2 inches up to 24 inches in length! Depending on the species, they usually feature bright hues of green and yellow with various patterns of spots throughout their body making them quite eye-catching reptiles! See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Chameleons are animals that are found throughout the jungle and desert alike, in Africa, Asia, and parts of Southern Europe , and chameleons have also been introduced to parts of North America. Most of these lizards live in trees or in bushes. Only a few species of chameleon live on the ground under piles of leaves. There are many animals that eat these lizards. In fact, the smaller a chameleon is, the more likely it is to be eaten by a larger animal. Some of the predators include snakes, birds, and sometimes monkeys . Though they can blend in with their environment, they are near the bottom of the food chain. This means there are many animals above them on the food chain that can eat them. A chameleon’s ability to change color to match its environment is its way of protecting itself when a predator is nearby. If this lizard is on a branch, its skin can turn a color that is very close to the color of the branch. Many predators may pass by without ever seeing the chameleon sitting quietly on the tree branch. The chameleon is a very unique species of lizard, known for its ability to change color in order to adapt to their environment. It has been around for millions of years and is believed to have descended from the iguanid family. Chameleons are found throughout Africa, Madagascar, parts of southern Europe and Asia, as well as some islands in the Indian Ocean. The evolution of the chameleon has also enabled it to develop several interesting characteristics that make it uniquely suited to its habitat. They have specialized eyes with 360-degree vision which allows them to see predators from any direction, long tongues so they can catch prey quickly, prehensile tails which help them climb trees more easily, and claws that enable them to grip branches firmly. Additionally, their skin pigmentation allows them to blend into their surroundings almost instantly when threatened by a predator or other animals. Overall, the incredible evolutionary process behind the chameleon’s remarkable adaptation capabilities is truly amazing! Chameleons are known for their ability to change color, but they also possess many other interesting behaviors. Chameleons are known to be solitary creatures, spending most of their time alone or in pairs. They can often be seen basking in the sun on branches or leaves, and when disturbed they will normally take cover among the foliage. Their long tongues help them catch prey such as insects and small reptiles; they have excellent vision which helps them spot potential food sources from a distance. When threatened by predators, chameleons may puff themselves up to appear larger than normal and give off a hissing sound as a warning sign. In addition to this defensive behavior, some species of chameleon may even fight each other using their tails! Chameleons are animals that communicate with one another by using their body language. For instance, a chameleon trying to protect its territory from an intruder is likely to turn sideways. This makes the lizard look bigger and more threatening. A chameleon that feels threatened may open its mouth to try to scare another one away. Most species of these lizards lay eggs, while a few have live babies. The female digs a hole in the ground and lays her eggs inside it to keep them warm. Usually, they lay around 20 eggs, but it can be more or fewer depending on the species. It can take four months to a year for the eggs to hatch. Jackson’s chameleon is one example of a species that have live babies. This lizard can have from 8 to 30 live babies after being pregnant for about six months. Chameleons, like most other reptiles, reproduce sexually. During courtship and mating rituals, male chameleons will display their bright colors to attract mates. Male chameleons also use head bobbing as a way of flirting and competing with rivals for the attention of females. If a male is successful in both displaying his colors and winning the battle using body language instead of physical contact, he may be chosen by the female for mating purposes. The gestation period for chameleon eggs ranges anywhere from one month to several months depending on species and environmental factors such as temperature or humidity levels. After hatching from eggs laid in nests underground or in trees or bushes, baby chameleons are born without parental care; they must fend for themselves after birth. The lifespan of a chameleon depends on its species but generally ranges from five to fifteen years when kept in captivity with optimal conditions such as proper diet and environment being met regularly. Wild-living chameleons tend to have shorter lifespans due to a lack of food sources, predators, disease exposure, etc., which can drastically reduce their life expectancy if not addressed properly. Chameleons eat a diet that’s mostly focused on insects . While chameleons are omnivores that will feed on vegetation such as dandelions and other vegetation, most of their prey is insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, and dragonflies. For a full list of chameleon diets, give our ‘ What Do Chameleons Eat? 16 Foods in their Diet ‘ page a read! Chameleons are fascinating creatures that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, their numbers have been steadily declining due to a number of factors, including habitat destruction and hunting for the pet trade. As a result, several species of chameleon have been listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. For example, Parson’s Chameleon is classified as Endangered due to its restricted range and continued decline in population size from ongoing habitat loss, poaching for pets, and over-collection by scientists. Another species at risk is the Panther Chameleon which has seen significant declines in Madagascar due to deforestation activities such as burning woodlands for agriculture. Conservation efforts must focus on protecting suitable habitats so these amazing animals can continue to thrive around the world.",

    "Name": "Oenpelli Python",
    "Fun_Fact": "Oenpelli pythons are unusually thin for a python.",
    "Text": "The Oenpelli python is a long, thin snake that reaches 16 feet and can change color. This species lives in a tiny region in Northern Territory, Australia. It is one of the rarest python species in the world. This species only lives in Northern Territory, Australia. It is most often found in the Arnhem Land and Kombalgie sandstone gorges. The Oenpelli python is nocturnal and spends most days in the shelter of tree hollows, caves, and rock crevices prevalent in its home range. It is an ambush predator, so it waits for most of its food to come to it. Like other snakes, it is opportunistic and will take a meal where it can get it; however, its preferred foods are small animals like birds, flying foxes, possums, and rock wallabies. Some believe that it specializes in hunting birds – it climbs well and sometimes preys on birds up in the trees . The Oenpelli python’s scientific name is up for debate. In 1977, when it was first described, scientists classified it as Python oenpelliensis. Then, more researchers studied the snake; they came up with a few other ideas. At various times, this snake has been included with the Morelia and Simalia genera, and as a solo animal species in either Nawaran or Nyctophilopython . At present, it appears that scientists favor Nyctophilophython oenpelliensis , but Morelia oenpelliensis is probably just as accurate. Scientific discussion aside, the snake’s specific name refers to the area where it lives, Oenpelli in Northern Territory, Australia. Some call it the Oenpelli rock python, and the traditional name given to it by the people of the Arnhem Land is Nawaran. The name Nyctophilopython means – “night-loving big snake.” It’s Greek and breaks down like this: Nycto- translates as night, philo- is love, and python means big snake. The Oenpelli python occurs in an area of approximately 1,240 square miles in the Northern Territory, Australia. This is the only place in the world where it lives, and its population and habitat are highly fragmented. Scientists estimate that less than 10,000 mature individuals remain in the wild in pockets within their native territory. The biggest problem the species has is that cats and other invasive species eat the small animals that the Oenpelli python prefers. So, without a steady source of food, fewer snakes are born, and fewer still make it to adulthood to breed. They live in a remote, isolated region of Australia. As a result, we don’t have a lot of information about its population, rate of decline, or how many actually live there. The estimate of fewer than 10,000 mature individuals isn’t based on observation. Rather, it’s inferred based on environmental factors such as the numbers of their preferred prey and their population in the region. It’s also illegally collected for the pet trade, but no one knows how common this is, nor how much it affects the Oenpelli python population. In 2012, biologists brought several into captivity in order to breed them. The agreement is that after the captive population reaches a certain point, they will begin releasing them into the wild, thereby having a backup – just in case the wild population needs help. This is one of the exceptions to the idea that pythons are big, bulky snakes. It’s long and thin and may reach 16 feet long as an adult. The Oenpelli python has a triangular-shaped head and elliptical pupils and eyes that seem a bit large for its head. Its body is pale brownish to olive in color, with rows of large dark blotches down the length of its body. This snake has smooth scales, and it has over 400 belly or ventral scales – the only python species to have so many. Oenpelli pythons have iridescent scales, and the Bininj Aboriginal people have historically viewed it as a totemic animal. This snake also changes color – lighter during the day and darker at night. It also seems to lay large eggs – really big in comparison to other related snakes and almost twice the size of its close cousin, the amethystine python ( Morellia amethystina) . Scientists don’t know much about its mating habits in the wild, or any of its habits really, but in captivity, these snakes have mated in July and laid eggs in November. The clutch size was small, and only 6-9 eggs were deposited. This might be one of the least dangerous python species. Oenpelli pythons are nonvenomous, so there’s nothing to fear from that bite (other than razor-sharp teeth). They’re not usually inclined to bite, but any animal will bite, given the right set of circumstances. Aside from that, their sheer rarity makes even a brief encounter highly unlikely. As remote as their home range is, we don’t have a lot of information on how they interact with humans in the wild. However, a few videos have shown an Oenpelli python just cruising past the videographer as if they didn’t have a care in the world. Ironically, the remote nature of their home that makes surveying them difficult might be something that helps preserve the species.",

    "Name": "Hogfish",
    "Fun_Fact": "Hogfish can change their sex from female to male",
    "Text": "The Hogfish is a species of wrasse fish found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It has a distinctive pig-like snout and is known for its delicious taste and firm flesh, making it a popular choice for seafood lovers. This attractive fish can measure up to 24 pounds and reach a maximum length of 36 inches. It is also a popular sportfish, with anglers targeting them for their strong fighting ability and vibrant colors. However, not only are Hogfish found in shallow waters near coral reefs they also make beautiful-looking pets in saltwater aquariums. This species of fish belongs to the wrasse family known as Labridae. It is classified as a ray-finned fish called Actinopterygii. Therefore, giving its scientific name Lachnolaimus maximus. There are roughly 45 different varieties of Hogfish species, but the following are the most prevalent ones, namely: Hogfish have a distinctive appearance that makes them easily recognizable. They have a long, laterally compressed body that is similar in shape to snapper or grouper fish . Their body color varies from a reddish-pink to yellow color, with white and yellow fins. Its most notable feature is their large, protruding lower jaw, which gives them a characteristic “hog-like” appearance. Hogfish also have large, expressive eyes and a dorsal fin that runs the length of their body. They can grow up to 2 feet in length, with males being larger than females. Hogfish are known for their ability to change color, which they use to communicate with other Hogfish or to blend in with their surroundings. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These fish have a broad distribution ranging from North Carolina to the coast of Brazil, including the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Gulf of Mexico. The population of this fish species is considered stable due to fishing limitations and fishermen being monitored by the Wildlife Conservation Commission. All these regulations protect these unique fish from overfishing. Hogfish are bottom-dwelling fish found near coral reefs and deeper waters at depths of 10 to 100 feet. Because they don’t migrate, they typically stay in the exact location all year round. The term Lachnolaimus maximus is derived from the Greek words lachne meaning wool, and laimos meaning throat, referring to the hairy throat some species of wrasse possess. The specific epithet Maximus means most significant and refers to the fact that Hogfish is one of the largest species in the wrasse family. Originally found only in the Western Atlantic Oceans, Hogfish are now found all over the globe. Hogfish are preyed upon by a variety of larger fish and marine mammals. Their natural predators include larger predatory fish such as barracuda , groupers, and jacks, as well as marine mammals such as dolphins and seals. Juveniles are particularly vulnerable to predation and are often preyed upon by a variety of smaller fish and invertebrates. To avoid predation, they will often take refuge in crevices in the reef or bury themselves in the sand, using their ability to change color to blend in with their surroundings. In some cases, Hogfish may also form schools with other fish species for protection from predators. These predatory fish have been observed to consume a range of prey, such as shrimp, crabs, calamari, and other small fish. Hogfish search for food in coral and sand using their sharp, protruding lower jaw, where they go on a feeding spree. Hogfish have a variety of diets depending on their size and age. Still, they are usually considered opportunistic feeders who use any available food sources in their environment. Hogfish reproduce by external fertilization, and when they are ready to spawn, the males and females gather in big groups. During the breeding season, the male frequently establishes and protects a territory, luring females to deposit their eggs, which the male then fertilizes. The fertilized eggs grow into larvae that float on the ocean’s surface before maturing into adults by settling there. However, before developing into juvenile fish, this species is unique because all the spawned eggs are only born as females but can later transform into males. In addition, they can have a long lifespan of approximately 11 years. Due to its popularity as a game fish, commercial and recreational fishermen greatly value Hogfish. The most widely used method for catching this species is bottom fishing. Bottom fishing involves casting a line into the ocean’s floor while weighted and equipped with a hook and bait. Other methods include using a spear gun or chumming the water with a mixture of fish byproducts and capturing the fish using a net . In addition, these fishing techniques can be successful depending on the angler’s skill level and the water conditions. It is prized for its delicate, sweet taste and tender, flaky flesh, which make it a delicacy. There are numerous methods to prepare this fish which include grilling, sautéing, broiling, and baking. It should not be overcooked because the toughness of the flesh can result from doing so. Tacos, ceviche, and linguine are a few well-known ingredients that can be added to create a Hogfish dish. In addition, it’s important to cook your fish at an internal temperature of 145°F to eliminate any potential foodborne pathogens.",

This branch of ancient reptilians is actually much older than the branch that would eventually lead to the dinosaurs and birds. See all of our expert product reviews . In fact, One ancestor, Pogona barbata , had a lot of yellow pigment in its mouth so any Pogona today with the same characteristic has at least some P. barbata bloodline. These days, Bearded dragons are now found in many deserts and other dry climates in Australia. The bearded dragon is this reptile’s common name while its scientific name is Pogona Vitticeps. Look a little further into the taxonomy of this reptile and you’ll see it belongs to the Agamidae family and its classification is Reptilia. The scientific name of this animal comes from the Greek words Pogona (Pogon) meaning beard and Vitticeps meaning striped beard. Central Bearded Dragon: The central bearded dragon ( Pogona vitticeps ) is also known as the inland bearded dragon. It is also the most common species found as a pet. Eastern Bearded Dragon: The eastern bearded dragon ( Pogona barbata ), also known as the common bearded dragon or simply bearded lizard. Despite being a member of the toxic-bearing species, they are non-venomous however, they can bite. Rankin’s Dragon Pogona Minor Dragon: Rankin’s dragon ( Pogona henrylawsoni ) is a species of Australian agamid lizard. It may also be called the pygmy bearded dragon. They are a smaller cousin of the common bearded dragon and are just as friendly. Pogona Minor Dragon: Pogona minor minima, the Abrolhos bearded dragon or Abrolhos dwarf bearded dragon, is an agamid lizard. They produce relatively large clutches of eggs (about 30 eggs at once!) A bearded dragon has yellowish, tan skin. It has a long body with a tail measuring more than half of its total length. A bearded dragon can measure up to 2 feet in length including its tail. An adult bearded dragon can weigh up to 18 ounces. Grab 2 cans of soup from your kitchen pantry and imagine that a bearded dragon’s weight is equal to about a can and a half. This reptile has spines under its chin and along the sides of its body. Also, it has ear holes on the sides of its triangular head. A bearded dragon has four sturdy legs and sharp claws that help it to climb trees. A bearded dragon protects itself from predators by changing color and blending into its environment. Plus, its scales and spiny skin help to protect it when a predator like a snake or a hawk tries to grab it. When this animal feels threatened, it puffs up its spiny beard and opens its mouth to make itself appear larger to enemies. Bearded dragons are shy, solitary animals except during mating season. They can be aggressive only when they feel their territory is being threatened. Also, males can be aggressive while choosing a mate. The spiny beard of a bearded dragon helps it to communicate in many ways. When this reptile changes the color of its beard and quickly bobs its head it is trying to show dominance over another male. When a bearded dragon bobs its head slowly and raises one of its legs, it is showing that it’s not a threat to another dragon in the area. There are 8 species of bearded dragons that live across the continent of Australia . They live in arid and subtropical environments including savannas, woodlands, and deserts. Lots of bearded dragons climb into trees and sit on branches to sun themselves. Being up so high allows them to be on the lookout for predators in the area. Plus, they can change skin color blending in with the branch they’re sitting on. Other bearded dragons sun themselves on rocks. If this reptile sees a predator while sunning itself on a rock, it scurries into a crack between rocks to hide underground. When the cold weather season starts in the autumn, bearded dragons go into a type of hibernation called brumation. While in brumation, this reptile is not completely asleep like a bear would be. The difference is it doesn’t eat during this period but does drink water to stay hydrated. Bearded dragons are omnivores. They are not picky about their diet. They eat insects such as cockroaches , crickets, and locusts . In addition, they will snack on flowers, fruit, and leaves. Some bearded dragons eat lizards and small rodents such as mice . These reptiles eat about once a day. If an adult bearded dragon is hunting crickets, it may eat 2 or 3 large ones. A baby bearded dragon that is growing quickly is likely to eat more than an adult reptile. Fireflies and other insects that glow in the dark are poisonous to bearded iguanas . The chemical in a firefly’s body that makes it glow is harmful to a bearded dragon. In addition, bearded dragons do eat fruit, however, avocados are poisonous to them. For a complete list of foods bearded dragons eat, check out our “ What Do Bearded Dragons Eat? ” page. Snakes , birds, dingoes , goannas, and crocodiles are all predators of a bearded dragon. An owl may fly down to a branch to grab a bearded dragon that’s sunning itself. Or, a dingo may capture a bearded dragon that’s lying on a rock to get some sun in the afternoon. Though a bearded dragon can run up to 9 miles an hour, it isn’t as fast as some of its predators. The habitat of bearded dragons is threatened. When trees are cut down or land cleared, bearded dragons have no place to live. Also, some bearded dragons are caught and sold as exotic pets in other countries. This reduces the population in the wild. Fortunately, there are preserves in Australia where bearded dragons are cared for and protected from both of these threats. Their official conservation status is Least Concern . Bearded dragons mate in the spring and summertime. During mating season, a male bearded dragon bobs its head and stamps its feet to attract a female. A female can lay from 11 to 30 eggs at a time. After mating with one male, a female may lay two or three different groups of eggs that number 11 to 30. A female bearded dragon may lay 9 groups or clutches of eggs in one year. The gestation period of this reptile is 55 to 75 days. This is a lot shorter than an iguana’s which is 90 to 120 days. It’s possible for the sex of a bearded dragon to change while it’s incubating. A developing male can develop into a female bearded dragon if the temperature during incubation is especially hot. It takes about three days for a baby bearded dragon to break out of its egg. Its birth weight is around one ounce and it’ll be about 3 to 4 inches long. A baby bearded dragon that is 4 inches in length is just a little longer than a crayon. Baby bearded dragons are sometimes called hatchlings. Once a female bearded dragon lays her eggs, she doesn’t see them again. They are on their own immediately after they hatch. Bearded dragons live for about 15 years. Pet bearded dragons may live a little longer because of the lack of threat from predators. These reptiles are sometimes vulnerable to respiratory infections and parasites but otherwise live healthy lives if they take in enough nutrition. The oldest bearded dragon is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. This bearded dragon named Sebastian lived to be 18 years old. He died in 2016 in England. There are several key differences between male and female bearded dragons , Males are typically about 20% larger in terms of weight. Most importantly, male bearded dragons will have two hemipenal bulges. There is where the sex organs of male bearded dragons are kept. In females, there will be a single bulge that’s centered on their bodies. The official conservation status of the bearded dragon is Least Concern. The population of these reptiles remains steady in Australia. Plus, there are over 900 bearded dragons living in zoos throughout the world. There are laws in Australia protecting bearded dragons from poachers who capture them and try to ship them out of the country. Today, many bearded dragons are bred outside of Australia. Bearded dragons are one of the more popular choices for pet lizards . In captivity, they generally grow up to 24″ long and live 10 years on average. When young, they eat an even mix of plants and insects, and as they mature their diet goes heavily plant-based, with only about 10% insects. A terrarium of a minimum of 40 gallons would be needed to create a good habitat for your pet, and factors to take into account would include: heating, substrate, lighting, humidity, temperature, and decor.",

    "Text": "When threatened, the promiscuous knight anole rises on all fours, turns bright green, and gives a menacing look. Knight anoles are the largest anole species. An average anole can grow to be as long as 20 inches. The vertebrates were originally natives of Cuba but have been introduced to Florida. They are quite common and are bigger than the green and brown anoles most people in Florida are familiar with. Knight anoles are fiercely territorial. They are bold and tend to face any perceived threat rather than back down. The scientific name of the knight anole is Anolis equestris. It belongs to the genus Anolis, while the common name ‘equestris’ is a Latin word that means ‘mounted.’ It is also commonly called Cuban knight anole or Cuban giant anole in reference to its native country. In Cuba, the lizard is known by the native name “chupacocote.” It belongs to the Dactyloidae family. Anolis equestris belongs to a group of anoles called the equestrus species complex. They are grouped together because of the remarkable similarities in their appearance, behavior, and ecomorphs. The other species in the equestrus species complex are: The knight anole is the largest species of anole. It has a large, bony head that can be likened to the knight piece in chess, hence its name. This lizard can grow to a length of up to 20 inches, longer than the green and brown anoles. They typically weigh between 0.56 and 4.83 ounces. They are sexually dimorphic, with the male anoles tending to be larger than the female species. The snout-tail length for an average male is typically between 3.9 and 7.5 inches, while that of the female is around 3.5–6.3 inches. In both males and females, their tails are longer than their bodies bringing the total length of the lizard to about 13–20 inches. Although this lizard is primarily green, it can change its color to light brown depending on its mood and the environment. The color of the young anole is a lighter shade, and they often have color bands. The anole has several teeth which are small and sharp, with which they can deliver painful bites. Knight anoles are diurnal. A group of anoles is called a “lounge.” However, they are rarely found in groups because they’re mostly solitary and territorial. When a perceived threat approaches, the knight anole puts up an elaborate display. They sit high on their four limbs to create a menacing look. They also change color and bob their heads at the intruder. This lizard can also puff itself up while males extend their dewlap. Interestingly, They are less aggressive in captivity. But that’s not to say they’re completely docile. The knight anole does not like to be held and can deliver a painful bite. However, if they have been raised from birth, they can be gentle enough to be held by the people they’re familiar with. This lizard is native to Cuba and was introduced to Florida in 1957 . The introduction happened in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The eventual spread of this species to other counties in Florida has been speculated to be both natural and human-assisted. As a result, they are now widespread in the southern Florida region. Another speculation made about the cause of the spread is the possibility of their escape from careless owners in Florida, after which they begin to multiply rapidly. They are arboreal animals that live at altitudes ranging from near sea level to about 3,300 feet. Their natural habitat has many trees, and they spend a lot of time up the trees. Sometimes they move from one tree to the other or to the ground to thermoregulate. You may also find this lizard on rocks, asphalt, or sidewalks. In addition to forest habitats, the knight anole lives in mangroves, savannas, and cultivated gardens. The species is not built to withstand cold. It is a popular sight to see them freeze and fall to the ground from trees during winter in Florida. Although they’re largely solitary, you may find them huddled together for heat during cold seasons. Knight anoles are mostly carnivores. The diet of the young knight anole is mainly insects when they are still young. However, older anoles have a more varied diet, including invertebrates such as snails or even fruits. They may even eat vertebrates like small birds, frogs , and other reptiles (including other anoles). The invasive knight anoles can reproduce and multiply at a very fast rate. This makes them a threat to other species as they saturate and dominate limited space and resources. They are not near extinction since they can multiply quickly with minimal effort. Snakes and birds are their most common predators. Larger anoles may also prey on juveniles. Their population is currently not under threat. Anolis equestris is polygynandrous. This implies that the male and female anoles have more than one reproductive partner in one breeding season. The species are oviparous, and they reproduce during the summer. Their behavior during the mating season tends to be similar to how they behave when they feel threatened. The males frequently nod their heads. They also expand and contract their dewlaps as a sort of mating display. After mating, the female Cuban giant anole lays eggs about an inch in length after every 10 days. The young anoles hatch out of their eggs after 45 days. Juveniles look similar to adults but are smaller and more lightly colored. The hatchlings are usually 2-5 inches long. Young anoles are self-sufficient from birth, and adults don’t exhibit any parental care. The lifespan of the Cuban knight anole is a function of how well they are treated. They tend to live longer when they regularly feed on insects and bugs. They can live as long as 10 years in captivity with quality care. The current population trend of the knight anole is unknown. However, they have been assessed by the IUCN to be a Least Concern animal. This means that they do not currently face any population threat and are abundant in the wild They have extended beyond the shores of their native country (Cuba) and are now found across Florida, with a stable population.",

    "Name": "Img Boa Constrictor",
    "Fun_Fact": "The first IMG boa was born in a litter of anerythristic boas.",
    "Text": "The IMG boa constrictor changes color as it ages, often becoming almost black. Designer snakes have been popular among ball pythons for a few decades. However, boa constrictors have fewer color and pattern mutations, so breeders constantly seek to develop new and beautiful colors for snake enthusiasts. Boa constrictors are one of the few animals where at least one of their common names is their scientific name. Until recently, the species Boa constrictor consisted of one species with numerous subspecies based on locality or color variation. The Colombian boa and Central American boas are good examples of this. They were classified as Boa constrictor constrictor and Boa constrictor imperator, respectively. However, more recent research indicates that this is incorrect and that they are different species, Boa constrictor and Boa imperator . Boa constrictors are also called red-tailed boas because their color pattern in the saddle markings shifts to red at the tail. IMG boa constrictors are a color mutation that stands for “increased melanism gene.” It describes how their color changes as they age. Their heads are triangular with blunt noses that are just a little pointed. IMG boas are active at all hours of the day and have elliptical, cat’s-eye pupils like other boa constrictors. These snakes have a mouth full of razor-sharp, recurved teeth that are designed to hold prey in place while the snake subdues the animal for leisurely swallowing. Along their labial (lip) scales, IMG boas have heat-sensing pits that allow them to find warm-blooded food, even at night. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Boa constrictors are large, heavy-bodied snakes that, as their name suggests, constrict their prey to subdue it before swallowing it whole. They’re big, powerful snakes that often exceed ten feet in length as adults. Traditionally, boas are gray, cream, or brown bases with oval saddle markings that become more pronounced and very red as they approach the tail. These may be completely absent in the IMG boa mutation, and the head stripes typical of boa constrictors may either blend with the base color or be absent. Owning one of these as a pet means that you’ll have to have help handling it, not because they’re overly aggressive. Rather, accidents happen because they’re big, and snakes do snake things, given the right stimulus. That aside, the species is relatively docile and does make a beautiful pet . In the early 2000s, Peter Kahl found the first female IMG boa in a litter of anerythristic boas and immediately spotted the difference. Anerythristic snakes are silvery and lack the ability to produce red pigment. However, the IMG boa looked like a normal red-tailed boa with more black pigment. Peter Kahl, the first breeder to prove the mutation genetic, said that it was the blackest anerythristic Colombian boa he had ever seen. The IMG boa constrictor looks like a darker version of a standard red-tailed boa when it’s born. You can tell that they’re different, but it’s not until after their first few shed cycles that the difference becomes more obvious. Snakes with this genetic mutation become darker and darker over the course of their lives; some individuals become almost completely black in the first year or two after they’re born. Boa constrictors are comfortable in a wide array of natural habitats in South America . Their range extends across most regions of the continent, including Brazil, Bolivia , and Venezuela; they’re only absent from Chile and Uruguay. Boas inhabit everything from tropical rainforests and the Amazon Basin to dry grasslands or rocky terrain. These snakes seem to have established a breeding population in southern Florida, causing many problems for native wildlife. Their large size means they can eat larger warm-blooded prey like small deer and even native alligators . Boa constrictors and Burmese pythons are hunted by wildlife officials and snake hunters in Florida in an attempt to reduce their population. Keeping in mind the native habitats will help you set up a proper enclosure for your boa. These snakes are semi-arboreal and need plenty of ground and climbing space. Adults of the species spend more time on the ground than in the trees, probably due to their size. However, providing climbing opportunities keeps their minds active. These are fairly active snakes, and even holding one is more of an activity than it is with ball pythons because boa constrictors are very inquisitive. As with other boas, IMG boa constrictors eat small mammals, birds, snakes, and lizards . They’re opportunistic and are willing to eat most prey items that they can fit into their mouths. This color mutation isn’t likely found in the wild, although stranger things have happened. These snakes are selectively bred specifically for sale in the pet trade. As such, they also don’t have any natural predators. However, boa constrictors in the wild are classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN Redlist of Threatened Species . Their population is decreasing, but not quickly enough to be placed in a higher category. Wild boas, especially juveniles, are prey for many larger carnivores. Wild felids like lynx and bobcats and birds of prey likely feed on these snakes. Since these snakes can swim, they may fall prey to crocodilians in the water. Even though over 100,000 snakes have been imported to the United States since the 1970s, most pet boa constrictors are captive-bred individuals. The species is widespread across the northern half of South America, and an accurate count of snake species is difficult to obtain. However, the population doesn’t appear to be fragmented, and the species is not threatened. Boa constrictors are live-bearing snakes and give birth to between 10 and 65 babies after 100 to 120 days of gestation. The babies are independent from the moment they’re born and may only stay with their mom for a few days after they’re born. The snakes reach maturity between three and four years of age, and females generally breed every other year in the wild. With proper care, IMG boa constrictors can live 20 to 30 years, but there are a few reliable reports of individuals living 40 years.",

    "Name": "Ribbon Eel",
    "Text": "The ribbon eel is one of 223 species of moray eel. The ribbon eel is also called a ribbon moray, a Bernis eel and a leaf-nosed moray. These eels live on coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans off the coasts of southern Japan, eastern Africa, French Polynesia and Australia. They can live for 20 years in the wild, but don’t survive for very long in captivity. This eel’s scientific name is Rhinomuraena quaesita . The Greek word Rhinomuraena translates to moray eel nose which refers to this eel’s distinctive elongated nose. The word quaesita means sought after referring to the fact that this eel stays hidden in coral reefs. Other names for this eel include ribbon moray, Bernis eel and the leaf-nosed moray. It is in the Muraenidae family and the class Actinopterygii. The moray eel family (Muraenidae) has 223 members! Some examples: This eel belongs to the moray eel family. This family has 223 members of different sizes and colors. Many of them live in coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Some species in the moray eel or Muraenidae family include: This eel has been compared to the mythical Chinese dragon due to its long curving body and dorsal fin. It changes color as it gets older. A larva eel is transparent while a juvenile is black with a dorsal fin of yellow. As it becomes fully grown, it turns a brilliant blue with a yellow dorsal fin. These eels are all born male but develop female reproductive organs later in life. At this point, it’s able to lay eggs. These eels can grow to 51 inches in size. The movements of this eel are similar to a thin ribbon waving through the air. A flowing, zig-zagging movement through the water. It’s easy for these eels to disappear into a tiny crevice in a coral reef due to their narrow body. Their speed combined with the ability to wiggle inside a coral reef can help these eels escape predators. This eel’s range includes the eastern coast of Africa, the northern to the southern coasts of Japan, French Polynesia and the northern coast of Australia. It lives in coral reefs and can be seen from one to 220 feet down in the saltwater ocean. The population of this eel is unknown. However, it’s considered Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Ribbon eels are carnivores that don’t need to leave the safety of their coral reef to find food! They eat small fish and crustaceans. Instead of coming out of its coral reef crevice, they stick its head out. It uses its fluttery nostrils to attract prey. A small fish or crustacean is likely to mistake this fluttery object as something to eat. When the prey gets too close, the eel grabs it. Fish that are larger in size and sea birds eat ribbon eels. Though they are sometimes captured and sold at a high price as exotic pets, these eels are considered Least Concern . Scientists believe the breeding season is sometime between late winter and early spring. A female lays eggs and a male releases sperm to fertilize them. They lay an average of four eggs that hatch in about eight weeks. Newly hatched eels are called larvae and are transparent. In short, they have the shape of an eel, but you can see through them. Soon, a ribbon eel progresses into the juvenile stage. At this point, its body is black with a yellow dorsal fin. At the adult stage, the eel becomes bright blue with a yellow dorsal fin. In the wild, these eels can live up to 20 years. Unfortunately, they pay a sad price when captured to keep as pets. They usually die within a month in a fish tank. Ribbon eels are not eaten by humans. Some humans capture them to put into aquariums in private homes or businesses.",

    "Name": "Uaru Cichlid",
    "Fun_Fact": "The color of the Uaru cichlid changes during the spawning season",
    "Text": "The color of the Uaru cichlid changes during the spawning season . Uaru cichlid is a freshwater fish native to the Upper Orinoco and the Amazon basins in South America. The fish is popular for its unique triangular shape and coloring, unlike any other fish in the cichlid family. Although native to South America , you can find Uaru species in aquariums all over the world. The Uaru is a genus of small to medium-sized cichlid fish native to the blackwaters and whitewaters of South America. The name “ Uaru ” is the local Amazonian word for toad. The Uaru fishes have a number of nicknames. The native name of this fish is Waroo. People call them “triangle cichlids” in reference to the triangular shape of the adult and “chocolate cichlid” (a name it shares with Hypselecara temporalis, another species of cichlid fish) . The Uaru belongs to the order Cichliformes, which includes two families. The cichlid family is the largest in this order and one of the largest vertebrate families. There are more than 202 genera in this family, with about 1,700 species identified so far. The Uaru genus lives naturally in the wild in South America. Hobbyists also keep them as pets in aquariums all over the world. This genus has two main species: Uaru amphiacanthoides and Uaru fernandezyepezi . The Uaru has an oval disc-shaped body typically of cichlids. However, the row of the spine in the fish’s dorsal fin gives it a more triangular shape. This is why people call it the triangular cichlid. The Uaru has a long anal fin which is nearly as long as the rest of the fish’s body. The long anal fin makes it a powerful swimmer. Uaru species demonstrate different coloration depending on their age. Juvenile fish are often a bland color with a mottled pattern. This dull coloration is an important camouflage that helps to protect this fish. The color makes them look like dead leaves, so larger fishes ignore them. As the fish matures, the color turns from a subdued gray-brown to yellowish color. It may also have small brown blotches. The eyes of large mature fishes are typically bright yellow with black pupils. The fish typically has a large tear-shaped black mark running across the lower end of their body, as well as a smaller mark at the base of the tail. The mark can be distinct or subdued from one individual to the other. Uaru species have scaly bodies. However, the small size of these scales makes the fish’s body smooth and leathery. The small size of these scales gives their body a smooth and leathery appearance. In its natural habitat, the Uaru can grow to lengths of up to 12 inches, but it only grows to about 10 inches in a tank. Adult Uaru changes color just before spawning season. The color of their entire body becomes darker, with a bit of brown coloration along the edges. Their yellow eyes also become reddish, giving the fish a fiercer appearance. Uaru cichlid is native to South America. The two species in this genus have varying ranges and distributions. Uaru amphiacanthoides are found in the clear streams of the Amazon Basin in Northern Brazil and Guyana. Uaru fernandezyepezi, on the other hand, is found in the Orinoco Basin in Venezuela and Colombia . In the wild, this freshwater fish is mainly found in blackwaters and whitewaters. As a popular fish in the aquarium trade, this fish is also bred in captivity. It is best kept in a large, roomy aquarium with gravel or sand as a substrate . The tank is typically decorated with roots and bogwood. Since they’re raised in home and commercial aquariums, Uarus are not at risk of extinction. It is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN red list, which means the population is relatively stable and not under threat. Fishes are the first vertebrates to have ever evolved. The ancestors of modern fishes first appeared about 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion . The earliest fishes were primitive filter-feeders. It wasn’t until the Late Ordovician that the first fishes with defined jaws appeared. They became more widespread during the Devonian, which is commonly referred to as the “age of fishes.” The ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii) evolved about 420 million years ago. They’re the dominant vertebrate group today. Within this group, the family Cichlidae is the biggest and most diverse. They arose within the order of Cichliformes about 100 to 80 million years ago. Cichlids are renowned for their rapid evolutionary radiation and diversity across different habitats. There are several instances of their lineage evolving the same traits and even reversion to ancestral traits within the family. The Uaru is an omnivore, which means it eats anything from small fish, shrimps , worms, and aquatic plants. Uarus don’t have a lot of natural enemies. They are mostly threatened by humans, who catch them for food. They are also preyed on by other bigger fishes within their ecosystem. In its natural habitat, the Uaru cichlid is an omnivore that eats crustaceans, insects , detritus, worms, fruits, and plants. In home aquariums, the fish is not a picky eater. It can be fed with frozen bloodworms, live earthworms , black worms, frozen brine shrimps, blanched lettuce, and peas. Both male and female Uaru cichlids appear very similar to one another. This makes it difficult to distinguish between them. They reach maturity between five and six months and then move in pairs to mate. During the breeding season, their appearance changes to a darker color with coppery red eyes. The female produces between 100 and 400 eggs and lays on a flat rock surface for the male to fertilize. The pair (male and female) take turns guarding the eggs against predators. Males eat non-viable eggs. However, in some cases, they may end up eating the entire clutch. The Uaru eggs hatch within five days and are then moving to a shallow nest by their parents, feeding them with secretions from their skin for a week. Once the fry starts swimming, they become independent of their parents. However, the fry still stays close to the parent. The average lifespan of the Uaru cichlid is between 8 and 10 years. Uaru fishes are native to South America, especially in the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers. They are not endangered and are relatively common in their native habitat. Natives consider them important food fish. It is mainly kept as a pet in other regions of the world. They are mostly sold in pet stores and can also be purchased online.",

    "Name": "Cuttlefish",
    "Text": "Equipped with flexible tentacles, ink production capabilities, and a keen intelligence, the cuttlefish is a remarkable creature of the sea. Despite the name, it is not really a fish at all, but a type of cephalopod. This puts it in the same class as the squid , nautilus, and octopus . It is often said that the cephalopods resemble aliens on Earth in the sense that it’s a remarkably intelligent but very different type of lifeform from us. They last shared a common ancestor with land animals some hundreds of millions of years ago. 5 Incredible Cuttlefish Facts Want more cuttlefish facts? Check out ‘ 10 Impressive Cuttlefish Facts ‘ which has much more on their color changing and intelligence! See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The scientific name of the cuttlefish is Sepiida , which refers to the entire order. The term Sepiida derives from the Greek and Latin word sepia , which is a reference to the name of the dye produced from its ink. Sepia is now the English word for a type of reddish-brown color. There are approximately 120 species of cuttlefish still alive. Here is just a small sample of them: Cuttlefish are some of the most ancient living creatures that swim the oceans today. Scientists believe the first cuttlefish began to emerge from their progenetors sometime 500 million years ago. Early cuttlefish greatly resembled their cousin the nautilus, being encased in a similar protective shell. Soon ancient cuttlefish began to develop the trait of camouflage, fine-tuning and perfecting their tactics for blending in with their environment for millions of years until shell was no longer necessary for their survival. Cuttlefish are able to use their camouflage by activating the 20 million chromatosphores on their skin- these are specialized cells that control pigmentation. In addition to defending themselves from predators, cuttlefish have also evolved to use their color changing skin for communicating with other members of their species, with males often showcasing a complex pageant of color patterns in order to attract a mate. One look at this fish will tell you that it’s a true cephalopod. Its body resembles the closely related squid and octopus , except it is much smaller in size. The smallest cuttlefish species only measure an inch or two. The largest species is the Australian giant cuttlefish, which can measure up to 20 inches and weigh about 23 pounds. The cuttlefish is characterized by the gas-filled internal cuttlebone (which actually provides buoyancy and control rather than protection), a long and relatively flat body, a parrot-like beak, and long fins running along both sides. It also features eight arms and two tentacles containing a series of suction pads that are used to capture prey. The arms and tentacles can be withdrawn into two pouches at any time. Cuttlefish are also one of the few animals that have multiple hearts . In total, they have three different hearts! Two of those hearts supply blue-green blood to its gills while the third supplies oxygen to the rest of its body. Why is its blood blue-green instead of red? Because cuttlefish blood contains hemocyanin which itself contains copper, rather than hemoglobin which contains iron. The cuttlefish moves at incredible speeds through the water via jet propulsion. It does this by sucking in water through a body cavity and then expelling the water out with its powerful muscles. The fins allow it to maneuver at high speeds. This method of transportation is necessary to evade very fast and agile predators. Another incredible ability is the color change. The cuttlefish body contains millions of small pigment cells called chromatophores that allow the creature to alter its color and pattern at any time. When the cuttlefish flexes its muscles, the pigment is released into the outer skin to blend in with the surroundings. This is used for many purposes such as to camouflage itself, attract mates, and communicate with other cuttlefish. The color change may also serve the purpose of stunning prey with quick and debilitating flashes. The cuttlefish has a rather large brain-to-body size compared to most invertebrates. Studies reveal that it is capable of various degrees of problem-solving and object manipulation. This intelligence may be necessary to manipulate the incredibly complex tentacles and arms, which contain a large number of neurons like the brain. The cuttlefish is found throughout the oceans and seas of Europe , Africa , Asia , and Australia, but it is largely absent from the Americas. Throughout its natural range, this animal exhibits a yearly migratory pattern. In the summer, it inhabits the coastal waters in tropical or temperate regions. In the winter, it migrates to the deeper water of the oceans. According to the IUCN Red List, which keeps track of the conservation status of many animals, data about population numbers is unfortunately not available for many cuttlefish species. When data is known, almost all species are categorized as least concern . Only a few species are at risk of endangerment. The cuttlefish has a rather simple diet consisting of fish , crab , and other mollusks. Larger cuttlefish also have the tendency to prey on juveniles or smaller species of cuttlefish. They use the beak located in the mantle between their arms to crack open the tough shells of their prey and feast on the tasty meat within. For a full analysis of what cuttlefish eat, we’ve published ‘ What Do Cuttlefish Eat? The 10 Favorites of Their Diets .’ Due to its small size, the cuttlefish is hunted by all kinds of larger fish, dolphins , seals , birds , and other mollusks. But it does have several defensive mechanisms to help it survive. When threatened, the cuttlefish can release a cloud of ink to confuse predators and then make its daring escape. The speed is a distinct advantage over slower predators. The venom of some species also provides a valuable defense. The cuttlefish has a very organized and straightforward reproduction cycle. During the breeding season, which lasts between the spring and summer of every year, the male puts on a brilliant mating display in which it transforms colors and patterns to impress the female. Once accepted, the male uses its modified arm to transfer sperm into the female’s mantle near the mouth to fertilize the eggs. The impregnated female then deposits 100 to 300 eggs at a time on rocks, seaweed, or other surfaces. She alone watches over the eggs until they hatch after a period of one or two months on average. Shortly after their duties are fulfilled, both the male and female will die, ceding the way to the next generation. Cuttlefish reach sexual maturity after a period lasting up to 18 months, but their life expectancy is a mere one or two years of age. This means they tend to perish after only a single mating season. Cuttlefish is a popular dish throughout the coastal regions of Europe and East Asia. It is prepared in various ways: breaded, deep fried, grilled, or shredded. The ink can be served alone or with the rest of the cuttlefish as well.

    "Name": "Gray Tree Frog",
    "Fun_Fact": "This frog can freeze itself by making glycerol that becomes glucose, which acts like antifreeze and stops its heartbeat and breathing!",
    "Text": "The gray tree frog can vary its color to match its environment and appear gray, green, and brown! The gray tree frog is a large species of tree frog that can take on many colors despite its name. It is commonly found in southeastern Canada and the eastern United States . The gray tree frog spends most of its life high up among the trees and is very adept at navigating the branches thanks to its sticky feet. The gray tree frog’s scientific name is Hyla versicolor , which is derived from the Latin for “variable color” due to its ability to alter the color of its skin based on certain factors, such as being a lighter shade at night and a darker tone during the day. It belongs to the Hylidae Family and Amphibia Class. Other common names for the gray tree frog are the eastern gray treefrog, northern gray treefrog, common gray treefrog, and tetraploid gray treefrog. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Genetic studies have shown that the gray tree frog evolved due to “multiple hybrid events” involving ancestors that have two sets of chromosomes. The species has been found to have DNA from Cope’s gray tree frog ( H. chrysoscelis ) and two other species that are now extinct but most likely were present in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the gray tree frog’s range. These frogs are almost indistinguishable from the Cope’s gray tree frog. The Cope’s gray tree frog has the same appearance as the gray tree frog and can only be identified by a slightly slower call. They are otherwise completely separate species, with the gray tree frog having twice as many chromosomes as the Cope’s gray tree frog. It’s uncertain how the gray tree frog evolved to be able to change color. Although it may seem like a chameleon in its abilities to adapt its color to match its environment in order to evade predators or as a reaction to the time of the day and related temperatures, there are several differences between the two animals. Apart from the frog being an amphibian and the chameleon a reptile, chameleons can change to a broader range of colors (including pink, orange, red, yellow, and blue), differing degrees of brightness, and combinations of tones. The chameleon is also faster at its color changes than the gray tree frog, and there are other reasons besides camouflage for it to shift shades such as for social signaling. These frogs are particularly unique because they are not necessarily always gray. Instead, their color variation can range from gray to green or even brown. It truly depends on its current environment and activities. It regularly alters its color to match tree bark, but its belly is usually always white. The gray tree frog is very warty in appearance. These frogs utilize a special grip on their hands and feet that allows them to climb vertically or horizontally with ease on trees and other objects. They are considered a larger example of a tree frog , being anywhere from 1.25 to 2.25 inches long depending on the sex. So on average, the frog is about three-and-a-half times as long as an aspirin tablet. Compared to other tree frogs, like the pinewood tree frog and squirrel tree frog, the gray tree frog has a weightier build. Two distinct features of adult frogs are the light spot beneath the eye and the bright orange coloration on the inner thigh. This bright color variation probably serves as a warning to potential predators. These frogs are solitary creatures and only spend time together during the breeding season. All other times of the year, they spend time hiding during the day and hunting during the night. During the day, they can be found disguising themselves under bark, rotten logs, leaves, and tree roots. It produces a sticky fluid from the tips of its hands and feet that allow it to climb into trees to hunt for food. The male of the species has a loud and almost birdlike call. It will make this call for hours after dusk as a way to establish a breeding territory. The males can be aggressive, but generally only in the breeding season when they need to defend their territory. They hibernate in the winter thanks to an adaptation that allows 80% of their body to freeze. They can survive extremely cold temperatures by hiding under rocks and other forest objects. These frogs are common in the eastern part of the United States and parts of southeastern Canada . This includes northern Florida over to central Texas, as well as all of South Carolina and Georgia. Being tree frog , they can usually be found in wooded areas, whether that is a forest or agricultural area. They will not be found far away from either trees or a source of water, like a swamp or pond. They spend most of their time in high treetops but can be identified in the vegetation of fishless wetlands during their breeding season. In the summertime, it is not unusual for people to see them on windows looking for the bugs attracted to artificial lights. This species of tree frog mainly feeds on different types of insects , such as snails , spiders , beetles , and the larvae of those insects. It spends most of its days high in treetops, where it can easily find moths , tree crickets, ants , flies , beetles , plant lice, spiders , and mites. It is comfortable jumping between branches to seek out its prey. They are opportunistic and will eat smaller frogs if given a chance. These frogs are very common and probably have a large population. However, regional populations in both the United States and Canada have to deal with the threats of habitat loss, water pollution, invasive species, and chytrid fungus. Different species of snakes , birds , small mammals , and even other frogs prey on these frogs. They spend most of their lives in the treetops to avoid these types of predators. They are also nocturnal and active at night to avoid predation. A known threat to these frogs is pesticides and insecticides that they consume on insects. These chemicals may have harmful long-term effects. The breeding season occurs after the frog wakes up from hibernation, in late spring and early summer. Males will defend an area around a water source and call out after dusk to find potential mates. Females will lay eggs in masses at the surface following mating. Each female will lay somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 eggs in batches of 10 to 40. The eggs hatch between 3 and 7 days. Young frogs are called tadpoles and live in the pond or water source they were hatched in until they are 4 to 8 weeks old. Then they complete a metamorphosis process and become young gray tree frogs or froglets. The frog’s lifespan is believed to be on average 7 to 9 years. This lifespan is similar for males and females. These frogs are known to be widely distributed across their habitat in the U.S. and Canada . However, there are no accurate counts of its population in any region. These frogs are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Most scientists believe there to be a large population that is generally not in danger of extinction any time soon.",

    "Text": "The green anole is the only anole that is native to the United States and is one of the best reptiles for first-time reptile owners. The small lizard is native to Georgia and South Carolina, found in the Southeastern United States from Florida to Texas along with the Caribbean islands. It is an arboreal species that is related to the iguana. Although they are often called the American chameleon due to their color-changing ability, it is not a true chameleon , which is not native to the United States. Other names are common green anole, American green anole, Carolina anole, and red-throated anole. The green anole, also known as carolinensis , and sometimes mistakenly referred to as the American chameleon, originates from the southern regions of the United States. Although it can exhibit color variations ranging from green to brown or spotted, its capability to change colors is relatively limited when compared to that of authentic chameleons found in the Old World. Anolis lizards have their roots in mainland America, but they have successfully expanded their territory to the Greater Antillean islands and subsequently returned to the mainland, creating three distinct categories (Primary and Secondary Mainland and Greater Antillean) in the process. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Furthermore, through DNA sequencing, it has been established that the anole is connected to larger lizards originating from Hispaniola. The green anole’s scientific name is Anolis carolinensis. Anolis is a genus of lizards in Iguana or Iguanomorpha suborder and the Dactyloidae family. It is part of the larger Reptilia class and Squamata order. The Iguana suborder includes the color-changing iguana, chameleon, and agamid along with New World lizards such as anoles and phrynosomatids. The green anole is a small to medium-sized lizard. It has a slender, agile body, a long, pointed head with ridges between the eyes and nostrils, smaller ridges on top of its head, and toe pads. The species is sexually dimorphic with males being 15 percent larger and females being smaller in all body size measurements. Males also have a dewlap (throat fan) that is three times larger than the female’s and turns bright red, whereas the female’s range from white to pale pink and is not a common feature. Males also have a dorsal ridge that they can extend behind the head while displaying or experiencing stress. Finally, males get scars on the head and face from fighting other males over territory or during the mating season. Females have a white stripe running along their spine, unlike most males. Additionally, there are heavyweight and lightweight size classes or morphs of adult males, which can both exist within one population. These differ in dominance, bite force, body mass and length, competition, and vertical jump. Color changing depends on the environment and health or mood. When it’s green, it’s active and in bright light. When it’s brown, it’s less energetic and in a cool or moist environment. The males puff out their dewlap, do pushups, or bob their heads when intimidated by other males. They are territorial and will fight with other males by biting, scratching, or chasing them away. They usually live in the wild with 2-3 females in a territory that is 1 cubic meter (35 cu feet). It is a fact of male territorialism that lizard owners should keep them alone or one male with a few females. Green anoles are diurnal (active during the day) and throughout the year. They are especially active during the spring and fall, while winter activity depends on the temperature and amount of sunlight. They are cold-blooded but heterothermic, meaning they can self-regulate their body temperature to a degree, but they also need supplemental heat for digestion and health. The typical habitat of green anoles is the moist forests and brushy clearings of neotropical and Nearctic regions including Georgia, South Carolina, and the southeastern United States. However, it has spread to the foliage of urban areas and the low country shrubs of the Carolinas as well as to Hawaii, the Ogasawara Islands of Japan, Cuba, the Bahamas, and Guam. Green anoles have a largely insectivorous, carnivorous diet consisting of mealworms, grubs, maggots, and small insects such as beetles , fruit flies, and termites. They also eat house flies in Georgia, South Carolina, and other southeastern urban areas, occasionally eat grains and seeds, and even other small lizards such as skinks. They only notice prey that is moving. For a full analysis of their diet, check out ‘ What Do Green Anoles Eat? The Main Foods in their Diet .’ One of the uses for the green anole’s color-changing ability is to hide from predators by blending in with trees and bushes. Broadhead skinks, snakes, and birds are common predators, with cats being another in urban habitats. Although the green anole is threatened by over-predation, it is not endangered in general. It did, however, go extinct on one island in the Bahamas due to the curly-tailed lizard, a ground-dwelling species which eats lizards and anoles. In Guam, predators such as brown tree snakes (scientific name Boiga irregularis) have reduced their population density. The brown anole is an invasive species in the green anole’s native habitat and competes with it for shelter and food. As a result, the green anole evolved to live higher up in trees and grow bigger toe pads to be able to climb and run faster. Green anoles reach sexual maturity at 8 to 9 months. The mating season for green anoles is from April through August or 4-5 months out of the year. During this time, males attract females with head-bobbing and extending their dewlaps. Females who are receptive to mating arch their necks. The male bites the neck of the female and this is a behavior unique to green anoles. He then places his tail under the female and then mounts her back. The warmer months have the highest reproduction rate due to the heat increasing the size of the gonads. Males are territorial in order to protect their mating partners from intruding males, while females mate in sheltered areas and closed terrain to reduce exposure to predators. Female green anoles have the ability to store sperm for delayed fertilization. The gestation period is 5-7 weeks, with the female laying one egg every two weeks for an average of 6-9 eggs a year. The eggs are buried in moist soil which the female digs and left to incubate and hatch on their own, meaning the young are left to fend for themselves. These anoles are the most commonly seen lizard in Alabama and the most common lizard in both urban and suburban areas in the southeastern United States. Florida used to contain the majority of green anoles, but they have been largely replaced by invasive anole species such as the brown anole (scientific name Anolis sagrei). On the other hand, the green anole is an introduced species in Hawaii, the Ogasawara Islands of Japan, Cuba, the Bahamas, and Guam.",

    "Name": "Ghost Crab",
    "Fun_Fact": "Their eyestalks, which are sometimes horned, can swivel 360 degrees",
    "Text": "Ghost crabs are one of the most populous crab species in the world and are found on beaches from Oman to Polynesia to Australia to Florida to Egypt and Greece. Ghost crabs, also called sand crabs, can be told from their boxy shape, their sometimes horned eyestalks, and the uneven size of their claws. They can move surprisingly quickly, and the fewer legs they use the faster they are. Although they use eight of their 10 legs to walk normally, at their fastest only the first and second pairs of their walking legs are in play. Ghost crabs are members of the subfamily Ocypodinae, which is found in the Ocypodidae family. Ocypode comes from Greek and means “swift-footed,” which describes the surprisingly fast way these crabs can scuttle over the sand. There are two genera in this subfamily: Ocypode and Hoplocypode . In the genus Ocypode, there are 20 species, but there’s only one species in Hoplocypode : H. occidentalis . Besides Hoplocypode occidentalis , the species of this type of crab are: These crabs have a boxy little body, and most species are pale with the exception of species such as O. gaudichaudii , the painted ghost crab. Their name comes not just from their general pallor, but from the fact that they hunt at night. Two characteristics that identify ghost crabs are that both the males and the females have claws of different sizes. This differentiates them from their cousins the fiddler crabs , where unequal size claws are found only on the males. The claws of most ghost crabs also have ridges that allow the animal to produce sounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Ghost crabs, or sand crabs, also have large and long eyestalks. In some of the Ocypode species, the eyestalks are horned or have stiles. The horns help biologists identify the species. They have huge corneas that are found on an eyestalk’s bottom half. Their walking legs are longer than the claws. This allows them to move quickly and easily over the sandy beaches where they live. Ghost crabs are found near warmer waters all over the world, like those off the coast of Florida or India . These semiterrestrial crabs dig burrows in sand and mud found in that zone between the high and low tide on beaches on the oceans or estuaries. There are 21 species of sand crab, and though their habitat has been disrupted by human activity, their population is fairly healthy. Most sand crabs are found in the Indo-Pacific region, while a handful of species are found in the Mediterranean , the Pacific coast of North America , and along the Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts down to Florida and further south to Brazil . Despite their small size, ghost crabs don’t have a great many predators. Besides the ability to change color, other adaptations that evolved for both hunting and avoiding predation are their speed and their nocturnal lifestyle. Still, ghost crabs are taken by shorebirds and raccoons . The crabs themselves prey on leatherback turtle eggs and hatchlings, which is problematic since the leatherback turtle is endangered. They also eat smaller crabs, other marine arthropods, and insects. Besides hunting for food, ghost crabs are scavengers and cache food in their burrows. Ghost crabs can mate all year, though there are some species where the female ovulates only in early spring and again in summer. They are unlike other crabs of their Infraorder in that the female can mate when her shell has hardened after a molt. This is one of the adaptations the crabs made when ithey became semiterrestrial. Males posture and make sounds to both attract females and challenge other males. Usually, the male crabs don’t make contact, but if one doesn’t submit, the stronger one shoves him out of the way. Fertilization is internal and mating usually happens near the male’s burrow. The sperm comes in a fluid that hardens and forms a plug in the female to make sure her eggs are not fertilized by a rival crab. The female can store sperm for a while, but when the eggs are fertilized, they emerge and stick to her abdomen. Since the eggs look like berries, a female carrying her eggs this way is referred to as berried. The female makes sure the eggs are kept hydrated and may sometimes swim upside down for this purpose. When the crab larvae hatch, the female shakes them off into the water. They are so tiny at this stage that they become part of the zooplankton and are swept along on the ocean currents. The baby ghost crab has five molts before it reaches the megalopa stage. It stays in that stage for a little over a month. If it survives to molt one more time, it leaves the sea for the land. Ghost crabs are ready to mate when they are about a year old and have a lifespan of about three years. The ghost crab population is healthy as of 2021, though it has decreased due to human activity, climate change, and pollution. Though ghost crabs are edible, they are considered too small in size to be good eating.",

    "Name": "Chinook Salmon",
    "Fun_Fact": "The Chinook salmon undertakes a long migration for the spawning season",
    "Text": "The Chinook salmon is the largest species of salmon in the Pacific; this is why they’re also called the king salmon. The Chinook salmon is among the most important fish in its region. It is a linchpin of the local ecosystem. Each year these salmon make an annual migration inland for the spawning season. They are concentrated in such great numbers in the streams that people and other hungry animals gather to catch them. However, because of the popularity of their meat, there is evidence that the stock of Chinook is being depleted in some areas of the world. The five types of salmon in Alaska – chinook, coho, sockeye, chum, and pink – come from the same family as steelhead, also known as rainbow trout. These salmon have been here for a really long time, showing up about 4 to 6 million years ago. King salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) holds the title of being the biggest among the Pacific salmon. They originally come from the northwest coast of North America and Northeast Asia. In the late 19th century, they were brought to New Zealand from northern California as a sport fish. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Further, around 5 million years ago, during the end of the Miocene period, the original Oncorhynchus fish in North America split into two groups. One group eventually became the Pacific salmon, while the other group evolved into the Western trout. The scientific name for the Chinook salmon is Oncorhynchus tshawytscha . The genus name Oncorhynchus is derived from two Greek terms: onkos, meaning lump or bend, and rhunkhos, meaning snout. This refers to the hooked snout that the male will grow in the reproductive season. Tshawytscha is the Russian name for this species in the far eastern part of the country. The Chinook is closely related to the sockeye salmon , rainbow trout , and pink salmon. For most of their adult lives, the Chinook salmon have a long, tapered body with a blue-green back, a silver sheen on their sides, and a white belly. This is accompanied by black spots on the upper half of the body and the lobes of the tail fin. Another black streak along the gum line gives them the alternate name of blackmouth. In preparation for the spawning season, the Chinook suddenly changes color to an olive-brown, red, or purple-hued body, and the males develop the hook on their upper jaw. The females, by contrast, can be identified by their blunt nose and larger mid-section. The Chinook is among the largest of all salmon . They typically measure about 3 feet long and 30 pounds in weight, but the world record was nearly 5 feet long and weighed almost 130 pounds. The Chinook salmon is native to the Northern Pacific region, from California to Alaska in the east and Japan and Russia in the west. This species has also been introduced to New Zealand , the Great Lakes region , and Patagonia in South America . They spend a great deal of their time at the bottom of the seafloor, hiding among grass and seaweed. Cool, clean water with plenty of oxygen is usually required for optimal health. According to the IUCN Red List, the Chinook salmon is a species of least concern . However, numbers can vary dramatically by region. Although many populations appear to be increasing, two populations of Chinook were endangered and seven more were threatened as of 2020. The biggest problems appear to be climate change, overfishing, the loss of habitat from dam construction and urban development, and polluted water from agriculture and logging. These stressed or endangered stocks are subject to intense regulation by the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). They are also protected by the Endangered Species Act. The Chinook salmon are primarily carnivorous in nature. They feed near the bottom of the seafloor, spending years gathering enough strength to return back upstream and spawn. The adult Chinook is preyed upon by killer whales , sea lions , and sharks in the wild. Juveniles are also prey for birds and other fish such as mackerel. Their colors provide a degree of camouflage against the seagrass in which they often reside. Adult Chinook primarily feeds on other fish. Juvenile Chinook feeds on insects and crustaceans . The spawning season usually takes place each year between September and December. The annual migration upstream is an arduous journey that requires a great deal of strength. Upon reaching their spawning location inland, the Chinook will dig out a gravel nest called a redd at the bottom of the stream. The female will guard her nest for up to 25 days, but the eggs can take three to five months before fully hatching. The fry will remain in the freshwater for the next 12 to 18 months as they feed and grow before returning to the ocean. The technical term for a species that migrates between saltwater oceans and freshwater rivers or streams is anadromous. The young Chinook will spend several years in the ocean growing as large as they can. They will reach sexual maturity at any point between two and seven years old. After spawning once, the Chinook die almost immediately. The Chinook salmon is among the most common commercial fish in the United States . Stocks are carefully regulated and managed to ensure that they are exploited in a sustainable manner. Thanks to the high-fat content, Chinook meat is said to have a rich taste. A single serving has around 350 calories and about 20 grams of fat. Chinook is fairly easy to roast, grill, broil, or saute. They can be served with seasoned butter, pesto, salsa, romesco, vinaigrettes, and other sauces; potatoes, rice, and lemon are also popular choices to serve alongside the salmon meat.",

    "Name": "Arizona Black Rattlesnake",
    "Fun_Fact": "Female Arizona black rattlesnakes sometimes share parenting duties.",
    "Text": "The Arizona black rattlesnake was the first rattlesnake seen interacting socially with other rattlesnakes. This venomous snake is usually between two and four feet long. The adults are dark brown to almost black, and juveniles are more brightly patterned. They live in the forests of Arizona and western New Mexico at altitudes above 4,000 feet. Arizona black rattlesnakes live at high altitudes in heavily forested areas of Arizona and western New Mexico. They thrive in cooler, moister conditions that the forests offer. They are often coiled up in leaf litter or under rocks, waiting for a meal to stumble near enough to strike. Many people say that they look like cow pies until they get close enough to spot their rattles and pitviper heads. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These snakes are most active from late March to late October. They retreat to a communal den to hibernate between late October and early March. Each year, they return to the same den, with young and mature snakes sharing hibernation space. Arizona black rattlesnakes appear to have some maternal instincts. As with other pit vipers, females stay with their young after birth for seven to 14 days or until their first shed. Scientists say that females sometimes cooperatively parent their young. A group of researchers discovered this for themselves when they began photographing a female and her brood in Arizona. A typically passive female, this snake “Poked her head out of her shelter and then proceeded to crawl from her refuge toward us, still rattling, and glaring directly at us. Our once-placid Woody was now fearless and wanted us to know she would not tolerate our advance.” The Arizona black rattlesnake’s scientific name is Crotalus cerberus , with its genus name describing its rattle ( Crotalus ). The specific epithet, cerberus, means spotted and originates in Greek with Kerberos . In Greek mythology, Cerberus was the three-headed guardian of the Underworld. In 1875, Elliot Coues described it as “Particularly repulsive due to the great size to which it attains, the caliber of the body, and the black color.” Coues called it the black rattlesnake , and the name stuck. It is endemic to Arizona and far western New Mexico, so it’s commonly called the Arizona black rattlesnake. Although many people also call it a timber rattlesnake because of where it lives, this isn’t the timber rattlesnake of central and eastern United States. That is a different species: Crotalus horridus . The Arizona black rattlesnake is a member of the Crotalus genus of venomous pit vipers in the family Viperidae, which scientists believe originated between 56 million and 48 million years ago in the early Eocene. There are a few theories on how rattlesnakes’ rattles evolved. One is their rattling behavior began with a defensive method, with the snakes rustling leaf litter to startle bison who shared their original habitats. Another is that the snakes’ excess shredded skin produced noise that could ward off predators. Snakes are thought to have developed keratin callouses on their tails, creating genetic differences that led to the evolution of rattles. The Arizona black rattlesnake was formerly classified as a subspecies of the prairie rattlesnake ( Crotalus viridis ) before being elevated to a full species. The National Parks Service completed a survey from 2003 to 2005 and determined that the species is relatively rare. Unfortunately, the species’ rarity made it impossible to collect enough information to estimate their population. However, the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish listed them as a “Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN)” in the State Wildlife Action Plan for New Mexico (NMDGF 2016). The IUCN has not assessed the Arizona black rattlesnake for inclusion in the IUCN Redlist. The Arizona black rattlesnake is one of 13 rattlesnakes that are present in Arizona. This snake is a medium size, heavy-bodied, and has a spade-shaped head. Juvenile Arizona black rattlesnakes have a base color that is light gray or brown with dark brown to black blotches that are roughly oval to rectangle-shaped running down the length of their backs that can end in bands around the tail. In addition, they have dark lines on the side of their heads, bordered by white or grayish-white, that usually cross over the top of their snout. The lines sweep back diagonally downward, and the dark line continues to the end of their jaw, the effect of which is a masked appearance. Over time, the snakes darken and become brown or nearly black, making their patterns difficult or impossible to see. Some Arizona black rattlesnakes have a unique ability: they can rapidly change colors under certain conditions. For example, a nearly black snake becomes a gray snake with a clear pattern in a few minutes, then back to normal when they relax. In addition, captive snakes sometimes lighten after feeding, and stressful events like being captured can trigger a color change. That’s not the only fascinating thing about their rapid color change! They also appear able to control the color change, and some exhibit darker coloring during the day and lighter at night. Like all rattlesnake species, they have a very advanced venom-delivery system. Rattlesnakes have fangs hinged at the base that fold up into their mouths. Like a hypodermic needle, their fangs are hollow and directly attached to venom glands. This structure allows rattlesnakes to grow much larger fangs that inject venom deeply into their victim. These rattlesnakes are considered moderately venomous, and a bite from one requires immediate medical care. However, they are not aggressive snakes; they are pretty docile. Most bites occur on the hands and feet because someone stepped on or otherwise harassed them. This species was the first that scientists observed exhibiting social behavior, such as communal parenting, sharing basking locations, and interacting with other snakes of its species. They often nest with other snakes, sharing den space, and the females share parenting duties. Most interactions with humans and Arizona black rattlesnakes happen when the snake passes through camping areas and across roads or paths. This snake will move along quickly if given the time to do so and doesn’t want to be near people.",

    "Name": "Giant Desert Centipede",
    "Fun_Fact": "They are the largest centipede in North America",
    "Text": "The Giant Desert Centipede is the largest centipede in Northern America. The Giant Desert Centipede is only found in two major regions but it is known by different names around the world. It is often mistaken for the Desert Centipede, which is a relative, but they both have distinct features that are different from each other. Giant Desert Centipede is referred to as the Scolopendra heros in the scientific world. Its origin is Latin, and it was named by Girard in 1853. It belongs to the order Scolopendromorpha and the family Scolopendridae. The species has a lot of different names like Giant Desert Centipede, Giant Sonoran Centipede, Texas Redheaded Centipede, and Giant Redheaded Centipede. There are more than 8,000 species of centipede in the world but, the population size of the Giant Desert Centipede is yet to be known. They are venomous centipedes, which are the largest in North America . Their population is restricted to only Mexico and some parts of the United States . Although their population is limited, they do not have any special conservation status. They only have one species, named the Giant Desert Centipede. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Around 12 to 60 eggs are laid by a female in one reproductive cycle. They remain in clusters in concealed spaces, under protection from the female Giant Desert Centipede. The females usually lay these eggs in either autumn or summer. She stays on guard until the hatchlings have had their second molting episode. The babies hatch from their eggs after two months. And the hatchlings are more or less the same in their physical attributes as that of an adult. The number of segments is the same throughout its whole life that can carry on for nearly a decade. However, it does go through the process of molting to shed its exoskeleton. After molting, they enter a new stage known as an instar. This process repeats a few times until they are old enough to mate. A Giant Desert Centipede measures up to 6.5 inches but it can cross 8 inches if it is out in the wild. It is the largest centipede in North America. Their head is flattened and round in shape and has a segmented body. Their head bears a pair of antennae that helps them navigate through their surroundings. This is because they do not have any eyes. Their head is sometimes orange in color along with the first part of their segmented body. That is why they are sometimes called “Giant Redheaded Centipede” or “Texas Redheaded Centipede” in various regions. But they exist in different colors. When it comes to their body, they have around 26 to 30 segments, each carrying a pair of legs. However, it is hard to determine which end is the mouth and which end is the tail, at times. Their legs are usually yellow and their bodies are often greenish black. They have a pair of elongated mandibles and two pairs of maxillae that can be used to pinch. Each centipede has around 20 pairs of legs and a set of hind legs at the back of its body. In total, they may have 21 to 23 pairs of legs. Their front limbs have injectors that carry venom inside that can help to bring the prey down. Their biggest survival instinct is their venomous legs. In addition, they display aposematism. This is a general phenomenon where an animal changes its color to warn the predator that they are poisonous. Since this centipede carries venom in its legs, it warns its predator by changing its color. This keeps both the prey and the predator safe from potential harm. They are nocturnal in nature. You can find them hiding during the day and coming out to hunt at night. In addition, although they are poisonous, they are only slightly aggressive. The Giant Desert Centipede is found only in two countries but its population is quite widespread. Some of the main regions where it is located are Arkansas , Southern Missouri , Louisiana , Kansas , Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , and Northern Mexico. They can take residence in any place where there is shelter. They stay hidden in the warmer seasons and are often seen out during cloudy weather. You can spot them in rocky woodlands, under rocks, potted plants , decayed wood spaces, and such. They tend to lay eggs under rocks or in concealed spaces so they usually stay hidden. Since they are nocturnal, you can only find them at night trying to hunt down their prey. The Giant Desert Centipede is slightly aggressive in nature. Although it is venomous, its venom is only used to subdue its prey. The venom is capable of paralyzing the nervous system of insects and making it difficult for them to escape. The same goes for smaller vertebrates. As for other vertebrates like humans , the venom has had different effects. A rat showed it was in incredible pain after the sting of the Giant Desert Centipede but went back to its normal state after a few hours. Similarly, when it attacked humans, the bite only caused swelling and sharp pain. This went away after a few hours and it has not produced any fatalities or deaths to date. Now, the venom of the Giant Desert Centipede has not been studied in detail much because it disintegrates quickly. But it has not shown to be much danger. Giant Desert Centipede are carnivorous in nature. They use venom to hunt down their prey but can also reach out in the air to feed on small insects. The centipedes are capable of eating small amphibians and vertebrates because of their larger size. A Giant Desert Centipede may eat small insects, toads , rodents , and small snakes , and may feed on moths if kept in captivity. Their predators include owls , coyotes , ringtails, bobcats , and badgers . The best advice for the Giant Desert Centipede would be to not bother them unless they bother you. This is because if they are provoked, they will be forced to bite you. But if you do come across one hiding out in your home, it is best to steer clear. A good rule of thumb is that it is best to set out precautionary measures. The pinch of the Giant Desert Centipede might not be fatal but it is extremely painful, nonetheless.

    "Name": "Green June Beetle",
    "Fun_Fact": "• Green June beetles will appear to mate in early summer, typically in May or June. This is why they are also known as May beetles. Therefore, it is very uncommon to see these beetles any other time.",
    "Text": "The green June beetle is also called the June beetle, May beetle, or June bug, and they are abundant in the South of Canada and the eastern United States. These bugs are notorious for their destructive and violent behavior. As a result, they are particularly problematic for farmers in Texas. Green June beetles are diurnal and will feed on crops and fruits. While they are less than a few inches big, they can cause a lot of damage. These beetles burrow into the soil at night and will emerge at first light. They derived their name from the month they are most active, June. Unfortunately, it is not easy to get rid of these beetles. Farmers have tried numerous strategies, and most are unsuccessful. The green June beetle’s scientific name is Cotinis nitida, and it belongs to the order Coleoptera , which consists of 360 000 species of beetles and weevils. It is the biggest order in the class Insecta and represents approximately 40% of insect species. June bugs are members of the family Scarabaeidae . There are over 1000 species of this family in North America alone. While members differ in size, they are instantly identifiable by their oval bodies, scalloped front tibiae, five-segmented tarsi, and lamellate antennae. In addition, they prefer feeding on flowers, plants, and dung. A beetle very similar to the green June beetle is the figeater beetle ( Cotinis mutabilis ) which belongs to the same Genus. These two beetles are often mistaken for each other because of their striking resemblance. Green June beetles are a stunning emerald color with golden or tan borders. There are also specs of gold on the wing coverings (elytra). Additionally, they have metallic bellies that are part brown and part green. Furthermore, their big black eyes are perched on either side of their green heads, and they have short brown antennae that split at the tips. Lastly, these green bugs can get pretty big and easily measure over an inch long. Due to their ability to fly, the green June beetle can be found almost anywhere. These beetles are diurnal, so they are drawn to lights when they are out at night. However, it’s uncommon to see them during the winter, and they are only generally sighted in May and June. June bugs are mainly found in agricultural areas, woodland borders, and in homes or gardens. In addition, they are commonly seen near compost heaps, where plenty of decaying plant matter can be eaten. Sometimes large numbers of adult June beetles are seen flying above the ground. However, the larvae live in rich soil or manure. In the Southeastern USA, adult June beetles have a varied diet but prefer stone fruit crops like plums and peaches. However, they can also consume quince, nectarines, raspberries, and apples. In addition, they drink from open flowers like blossoms, hollyhocks, and buttercups. While these beetles are not harmful to humans, they bore into ripe fruit and leave behind feces. The green June beetle completes its entire lifecycle in just one year. These beetles mate in the early morning. Females attract males by leaving scented milky fluid trails. Mating does not take long, only a few minutes. Once the female is fertilized, she will crawl into her burrow, which is usually built under matted grass. Female June beetles can lay between 60 to 70 eggs in their burrows over a 14-day period. At first, eggs are white in color and have an elliptical shape, but they gradually become more spherical as the larvae start to grow. After around 18 days, the eggs begin to hatch, and white grubs will emerge. Grubs grow to over 1.6 inches long and have a white body with a brownish-black head and brown spirals running down the sides of their bodies. These grubs will molt twice before the temperature decreases before winter. As they grow, they will change color to a shiny yellowish-white, which turns to a bluish-green toward the head and tail. In addition, they have stiff ambulatory bristles on their bodies, which help them with movement, as they generally travel on their backs. They feed off roots, decomposing organic matter, and kill the plants from the bottom up. They are at their most destructive when in their second instar stage and require more food to support their development. The larvae cause significant damage to lawns or turf grass. In fact, they are more dangerous to crops in their larval stage than as adults. They will start to pupate after the third larval stage, and this phase lasts up to nine months. The larvae will excrete a viscid fluid and fasten it with dirt particles to construct its oval cocoon. At first, the cocoon is white but will develop a green tint just before the beetle emerges. The adults start to emerge in May or June, 18 days after they begin to pupate. These beetles are typically 0.6 to 0.9 inches long and 0.5 inches wide. Their color differs from brown with green stripes to metallic green. Additionally, the elytra vary from orange-yellow to light brown. These beetles prefer to feed on various fruits like: However, they are more attracted to decomposing or bruised fruit, which is why their larvae are considered more damaging. There are several ways to prevent and remove green June beetles from your home; they include: You can make your own green June beetle trap from a large container with a wide-opening funnel top and some fruit juice. The beetles will enter the container and travel down to the juice but won’t be able to escape. While introducing natural predators won’t eliminate the entire population of June bugs, they do significantly reduce the numbers. Parasitic wasps are a good option as they burrow into the ground and paralyze the larvae before laying eggs on them. Once these wasp eggs hatch, they will start to feed on the grub. Other predators include: You can encourage these predators to move to your garden by providing them with a water source, shelter, and feeders. BT is an effective naturally occurring bacteria that will kill grubs when applied to flowerbeds and grass. It is organic and harmless to humans and pets, which benefits everyone. However, only use this product for severe infestations, and it should always be used with caution. Help mask dead turf and encourage recovery by maintaining a healthy lawn. In addition, if damage to your grass begins to appear, overseed with grass seed to promote rapid growth. Additionally, Continuous turf irrigation during June will deter females from laying their eggs beneath the soil, and if you have fruit, harvest them early and discard fallen fruit.",

    "Name": "Underwing Moth",
    "Fun_Fact": "Their colorful rear wing makes predators think that they are poisonous, however they are not it is a deceptive feature.",
    "Text": "The Catocala , also known as the underwing moth, is a genus of moths with bark-like forewings and very bright underwings. They are common in North America , Asia, and Europe and are known for their unique ability to camouflage with their environment and keep predators away by flashing their rear wings. Scientifically known as Catocala, the underwing moths are a genus that belongs to the family Erebidae. They were named by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1802. This genus contains at least 250-260 species of underwing moths. The name Catocala comes from two greek words – kato, meaning lower, and kalos meaning beautiful. This name comes from the beautiful rear wings of these moths. This name is pronounced as kah-TAH-kuh-luh. The underwing moths have very colorful and bright rear wings. Their forewings look like tree bark or leaves, which allows them to hide from their predators. On the other hand, their rear wings are bright in color and patterned in different ways. When camouflaging, they conceal their rear wings to prevent predators from seeing them. Their hind wings have stripes, which can vary in color to orange, pink, white, red, or black, depending on the species. When threatened, these moths show their rear wings, which throws off the enemy – a phenomenon known as deflective coloration . When flying, the underwing moths occasionally hide their rear wings in mid-air to deceive possible predators, also called flash coloration. These moths usually have a wingspan of about 2-5 inches, almost as long as a human thumb. The caterpillars of an underwing moth are grey or brown, allowing them to camouflage into their habitat. In addition, underwing moth larvae can change color to blend with their environment. The underwing moth is a nocturnal genus, meaning they spend the day resting on trees and the nights wandering. At night, they fly from tree to tree in search of food or, during the breeding season, a place to lay their eggs. This genus of moths is docile, and they tend to stick to themselves. So they do not fly in groups but remain solitary. They remain passive unless threatened or bothered, which is when they begin to move rapidly and show their rear wings. They also start flapping their wings so fast that it appears as though they are vibrating. Another behavior of the underwing moth is “playing dead.” They can become extraordinarily still if they feel threatened to try and cause predators to lose interest. Underwing moths also use camouflage to protect themselves. They only sit on trees that have the same color as their forewings, making them almost indistinguishable from the bark. It is thought that any loud noise triggers their sense of smell instead of a startled response. In addition, they have sensory organs that allow them to detect vibrations or sounds at a specific frequency, such as that of a bat , which is one of their main predators. Underwing moths live in forests with the same color bark as their wings, allowing them to camouflage effectively. This means that they typically thrive in deciduous trees. However, they can also be found in caves, under rocks and ledges, and in other bushes or areas that allow them to camouflage. The caterpillars of underwing moths live in tree canopies or soil. During the day, they hide at the trunk base, and at night they return to the tree to feed on the leaves. Almost half of all underwing moth species are found in North America, and the remaining species are found in Asia and Europe. In addition, a few unique species are found in the northern Neotropics and Indomalaya. Underwing moths are herbivores meaning that their diet is entirely based on plants. Most of the species feed on deciduous tree leaves in the forest. However, they can also feed on grass and other vegetation in their habitat. The underwing moths are preyed on by larger carnivorous animals and insectivores. These include, but are not limited to, birds, bats, lizards, and spiders. The moths often escape these predators by flashing their rear wings and rapidly flapping their wings. The bright color of their rear wings also gives some predators the impression that they are poisonous. However, they are not poisonous creatures. The primary food of an underwing moth varies depending on its habitat and the surrounding trees. But overall, this genus feeds on the leaves of the trees within their habitat, usually deciduous trees. They can also feed on grass and other plants within their habitat. Underwing moth caterpillars typically eat poplars and willows. Since underwing moths are tiny creatures, they are preyed on by many larger animals, such as birds, bats , lizards , and spiders . Predators aside, other threats that underwing moths face are habitat loss, deforestation, and pesticides. Too much artificial light and a sudden climate change also significantly affect their population. The underwing moth goes through a complete lifecycle before becoming fully grown. In the mating season, males locate the females by their pheromones. And once the mating process has occurred, the female lays her eggs soon after. In the summer, the female underwing moths deposit eggs on tree branches, either one at a time or in small clusters. These eggs only take 4-10 days to hatch if laid during the summer, but in winter, it can take up to 3 weeks. Once they hatch, they become a worm-like larva known as a caterpillar . At this stage of the cycle, they do not have wings. Instead, they wriggle around and hide on the branches of trees. After about one month, they become adult moths, and the cycle repeats. Baby underwing moths are called caterpillars and have elongated bodies with no wings. These are similar larvae to butterflies , except they are brown and grey instead, while butterfly caterpillars are more colorful. They eat plant material and leaves in their habitat and take about a month to fully mature. At the end of the caterpillar’s cycle, they form a chrysalis, and its body digests itself and forms an entirely new body with wings. The average lifespan of an underwing moth is not very long, only one to six months, after which they begin to wear out and spend less time flying. Towards the end of their lives, they become susceptible to some common ailments. These include: The overall population of the underwing moth genus is unknown. There are around 250-260 underwing moth species living all over the world, most of which have stable populations. However, two of their species in Missouri have a status of Vulnerable. The rest remain Least Concern , considering their rapid reproductive cycle.",

    "Name": "Kouprey",
    "Fun_Fact": "The kouprey is one of the rarest mammals in the world",
    "Text": "The kouprey (also known as the Cambodian forest ox or wild forest ox) is a type of ox that is native to Southeast Asia. They are the national animal of Cambodia and mainly dwell in a forest environment. The kouprey is considered to be one of the rarest animals on the planet, and at one point they were even believed to be extinct. There has not been many sighting of the kouprey since their discovery in 1937, but recent camera footage has shown that there are still kouprey roaming around, with parts of them being sold illegally. As a type of ox, the kouprey is an interesting animal that many of you might not have known existed, which we will discuss in this article. The kouprey’s scientific name is Bos sauveli , and they belong to the Bovidae family in the Bos genus from the order Artiodactyla. The kouprey is a moderately sized animal, reaching around 6.9 to 7.5 feet in length with a height of 5.6 to 6.2 feet, weighing anywhere between 1,500 to 2,100 pounds. Females tend to be smaller and weigh less than males, with a lighter coloration. Even though kouprey are heavy animals, they can still run quite fast at around 32 kilometers per hour. Kouprey have a defined dorsal hump on their backs and a long, narrow tail that reaches a length of 3.3 feet and ends with a furry patch. Both male and female kouprey have horns. The horns of the kouprey are the same size in both males and females, at around 32 inches in length. The female kouprey horns have a lyre shape, while the males are more intimidating and arch forward with a curved base. The kouprey nostrils are notched and they have an elongated face. Their legs are long, with a whitish-grey color past their knees that look like stockings. You can see kouprey in colors that range from grey, dark brown, and even black, but they all start off with a reddish color as a baby and juvenile before they turn 6 months old and begin to change color. One of the most distinctive features of this species is that their horns become frayed, especially in older males (bulls). The kouprey was first described in 1937 by the French zoologist, Achille Urbain after a young male kouprey was sent to the Paris Zoological Park. Urbain then described the kouprey as a holotype. At the time of the koupreys discovery, there were believed to be no more than 2,000 in the wild, which was in Thailand, northern Cambodia, western Vietnam , and the southern part of Laos. Kouprey is native to Cambodia, but now there are only a few left in the wild, making them rare. Throughout history, there have only been a few sightings of the kouprey, but no verified sightings occurred between 1969 and 1970, making scientists believe that they went extinct from their natural habitat. It was thought that only 100 koupreys were still in the wild, but some believe there to be up to 300. Regardless, this is still a small amount of kouprey in the wild. There are many interesting behaviors that have been discovered in a kouprey herd. The herd usually consists of around 20 koupreys that group together, with one female being dominant and leading the herd. As the kouprey bulls get older, they usually become solitary and leave the herd. Some bulls even start up a small all-males herd, while the rest of the herd consists of young bulls, females (cows), and their calves. In some cases, when all the males leave the herd, only the cows and their calves will remain and form their own small herd. Sometimes, the all-male herd and the rest of the herd join together when they encounter one another again. Koupreys are diurnal animals, that prefer to stay out in the open at night and take shelter in their forestry homes during the day. This diurnal behavior could be another reason that humans rarely see these animals. Kouprey can travel up to 15 kilometers a night in search of food and shelter, which is how the herds will cross paths and end up with each other again. Kouprey will also take a dip in mud baths and waterholes, which help repel insects and protect them from the harsh sun. The kouprey’s habitat consists of dry, open forests, with thick trees that they spend the day hiding under. However, when it gets hot, they will move to a denser forest that has better shade. Kouprey will also inhabit orchard savannas and barren land with trees, usually on low hills or plains. During the rainy seasons, herds by the lower plains will start to move towards the hills in search of higher ground, usually because of any flooding that occurs. They are distributed throughout Cambodia, their land of origin, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Kouprey is also distributed in wildlife sanctuaries, which are crucial for the species’ survival since not many can be found in the wild. The numbers and sightings of the kouprey are so low, that they are believed to be extinct in eastern Cambodia, aside from being found in the Mondulkiri Protected Forest . So far, kouprey can be found in the Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, the Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary. Koupreys are herbivores that spend most of their time grazing. They eat a variety of grasses which forms the main part of their diet, along with plant shoots such as koompassia, ploong, and bamboo . They will also consume sedges, and in the sanctuaries, they will enjoy salt licks as part of their diet. The main threat and predator to kouprey are humans, who use the animal for their horns and body parts to be sold illegally on the black market. Habitat destruction from logging and agricultural developments due to humans is another reason for their low numbers in the wild. Another threat that the kouprey face is from hunters, who then use parts of the kouprey for medicine, bush meat, subsistence, and money from trading. Parts of the kouprey sell for a lot of money on this illegal market, making them a desirable trophy, the skulls, and horns of the kouprey are also a target of the illegal wildlife trade, contributing to the kouprey extinction. Groups of mature bulls will seek out any of the female koupreys in heat (estrus), even if they have formed their own male-dominated herd. The male will then pursue the female until she is willing to mate. Once mating occurs, the female has a gestation period between 8 to 9 months, much like a human, and she will separate herself from the herd to give birth. Once the calf is born and around one month old, the female kouprey will then rejoin her original herd. The calves will have a red coloration, that changes as they get older to adult color. Kouprey lives for up to 20 years, similar to that of an ox, cow, and many other bovine animals. The kouprey population is very low, making them critically endangered and vulnerable to extinction according to the IUCN red list. They are also the most endangered mammal on the planet. There is now an estimation of 100 to 300 kouprey left in the wild, with speculation on whether they have gone extinct in their native habitat. This makes conservation important for the kouprey, and if we don’t do something soon, this animal can go extinct.",

    "Name": "Orchid Dottyback",
    "Fun_Fact": "This fish camouflages as its prey's parents to trick it into becoming dinner.",
    "Text": "This fish camouflages as its prey’s parents to trick it into becoming dinner. Orchid dottybacks are very popular aquarium pets because of the splash of color and activity they add to the environment. However, these bright purple fish are also crafty predators. They camouflage themselves in order to capture prey and manage to still look cute while doing it. The orchid dottyback belongs to the genus Pseudochromis and is classified as Pseudochromis fridmani . It is also a member of the famed dottyback family, Pseudochromidae . The generic name Pseudochromis is derived from two Greek words, pseudes meaning “false” and chromo meaning “color.” This is a nod to the abilities of the dottyback fish to mimic the appearance of its prey in order to increase the success of catching it. The specific name fridmani is to honor David Fridman, the man who collected the specimen in Israel. These fish are called dottybacks because of the colorful spots and patterns on their bodies. The orchid dottyback is also called Fridman’s dottyback or Fridman’s pseudochromis. Orchid dottybacks belong to the class of ray-finned fishes, Actinopterygii, which comprises over 50% of all vertebrate species alive. The earliest fossil record of an actinopterygian species was found to date back to the Late Silurian Period over 420 million years ago and belongs to Andreolepis hedei. Its remains have been discovered in Sweden, Estonia , and Russia . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The dottyback order, Pseudochromidae, are distinguishable from other fish families by the spines in their dorsal fins which number three or less, and also by their partial lateral line organ. Dottybacks also possess special cells which enable them to camouflage themselves by changing their coloration. These cells are known as chromatophores and they contain pigment sacs. When the fish pulls on these sacs with the use of small radial muscles, they can expand and contract the pigment, thereby changing its color. They use this feature of theirs to hide from predators, and also to entrap other fish as prey by pretending to be one of them. The orchid dottyback is a beautiful vivid purple, saltwater fish. It is often mistaken for the purple dottyback fish ( Pseudochromis porphyreus ) which is also a bright purple color. However, the orchid dottyback can be identified by the black stripe that runs across its head and over its eyes. The orchid dottyback is a tiny fish, measuring from 2.7 to 3 inches long. The coolest thing about orchid dottybacks is that they have the power of mimicry. Just like other members of Pseudochromidae , the orchid can change its color due to the chromatophores it possesses. Chromatophores are skin cells that contain pigment and reflect light. This gives the fish the ability to steadily modify their coloration. Orchid dottybacks have no sexual dimorphism. They all look the same, especially at a young age. When they are mature, the females do tend to have bigger bellies and can be a bit stocky as opposed to the slenderer bodies of the males. The orchid dottyback is a small, unassuming fish, but beneath their flashy exterior exists a cunning master of diguise. Dottybacks are one of many species of the dottyback family Pseudochromidae that are known to mimic the appearance of their prey. Orchid dottybacks possess chromatophores, or pigmented cells on their scaly bodies that reflect light and allow them to manipulate their coloration. By doing this, they mimic the appearance of their main prey’s parents. Orchid dottybacks prey on juvenile damselfish by pretending to be their parents, and it works! Scientists who studied the behavior of these purple tricksters discovered that when the dottybacks mimicked the damselfish, they were three times as successful in catching their prey. Sometimes, they even travel with schools of damselfish for easy access to prey. The only downside to their neat trick is that, unlike some other camouflaging marine creatures like squids , the dottybacks cannot change their colors instantly. It usually takes them many days to do so. Fridman’s dottybacks also use their obscuring talents to hide from their predators by camouflaging as their background. It has been observed that dottybacks would usually rather disguise themselves as damselfish to hunt prey than disguise themselves as their background to hide from predators. It is clear where their priorities lie. Orchid dottybacks are great starter fish for beginner fish owners. They are a hardy species and feeding them isn’t an issue since they eat just about anything. However, these fish are very territorial and can get aggressive with their space. Adding new fish to an aquarium with existing dottybacks may lead to bullying, so dottybacks are best added later to an already occupied tank. Orchid dottybacks should be kept in a lidded tank as well because they are very active and love to jump. They can become quite accustomed to their owners and are known to follow their them around in the tank when they pass by. Orchid dottybacks are rapacious predators for their small size. In the wild, they mostly prey on other smaller fish, primarily juvenile damselfish. These purple fish have quite the appetite and can eat as many as 30 damselfish every day. Orchid dottybacks are very opportunistic eaters. In captivity, they will eat just about anything presented to them. They especially love meaty food items such as brine shrimp , frozen mysis shrimp, plankton, and live worms . They will also eat fish flakes. The orchid dottyback is native to the Red Sea. The Red Sea is reputable for its salty water which is perfect for the dottyback. It prefers tropical water and loves to make its home in coral reefs , holes, crevices, and regions with abundant rocks. This dottyback lives in fairly shallow waters of up to 196.9 feet in depth. The orchid dottyback is also very popular as aquarium pets. They used to be expensive to obtain from their native region, but the appearance of breeders and aquarists helped lower the cost for pet owners. The exact population of the orchid dottyback is unknown, but the species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . The orchid dottyback is a protogynous hermaphrodite. This means that they are born with the sexual organs of both female and male and can choose which one to become. These fish are initially born female. The larger fish within a group would become the male. The sexual dimorphism in the Pseudochromis fridmani species is low. It is almost impossible to tell the males and females apart. At times, mature females have full bellies, slimmer males, but this isn’t in stone. Orchid dottybacks mate several times. The process starts when the male performs a mating dance outside his shelter to convince the female to enter. When she eventually does, she will lay up to 1,000 eggs. The male dottyback watches over the eggs until they hatch into babies called fry. They repeat the spawning process each week. Orchid dottybacks can live five to seven years in captivity and possible even longer when taken care of properly. Orchid dottybacks are small fish and as such are prey to larger marine animals such as eels, triggers, and lionfish . They might also be prone to saltwater fish diseases such as dropsy, marine ich, black ich, and ammonia poisoning.",
