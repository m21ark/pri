    "Name": "Rock Bass",
    "Features": "Black dots on their gill plates",
    "Fun_Fact": "Rock bass can change their color slightly to camouflage.",
    "Text": "The rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) also known as the black or rock perch , is a type of freshwater fish that belongs to the sunfish family. It’s a medium-sized fish native to the lakes and ponds in North America, popular with anglers for fishing purposes. They are generally smaller than smallmouth bass and have a distinctive appearance, making them distinguishable amongst other popular angler fish. Rock bass belongs to the Centrarchidae family in the Ambloplites genus. The binomial or scientific name for rock bass is Ambloplites rupestris . Rock bass is easy to identify when you know what to look for. These fish have a characteristically large mouth set underneath their eyes, which are a deep red coloration. These fish are not very large compared to other types of bass, only growing around 6-10 inches in length. They can weigh up to 3 pounds, but one pound is common in smaller specimens. Their color is quite interesting, and these fish have predominantly yellowish-brown bodies with silver and black. Shades of black are seen throughout the tips of their anal fins, and black dotted striped line their body horizontally. A black dot is located near the fish’s gill plates. The dorsal fin is spiny and lacks a uniform shape. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Even though rock bass is part of the sunfish family, they do not have a flat body. Their body has a less compressed body that looks similar to a bluegill and largemouth bass. It is not uncommon for this fish to be misidentified as warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), but instead of having three spines on their anal fin, rock bass has around six instead. This fish relies on their body coloration for camouflage purposes, which enables them to change its color to black or silver to match its environment. This can make it difficult to identify them if they are changing their color. This type of camouflage helps to protect them from predators, but it can also change with age and stress. Rock bass is native to east-central North America, but they have been introduced into Atlantic river drainages. They are distributed throughout southeastern Canada from Ontario to Quebec, toward the Mississippi River Basin, and all the way to Missouri and Arkansas. This fish is plentiful in most parts of the Dakota river in the U.S. and the Great Lakes region along with Torch and Champlain lake. They have also entered the Savannah River basin and eastern parts of the U.S., such as New York, Tennessee, and Kentucky. You can also find rock bass in the southern parts of Florida, Alabama, and parts of Georgia in the Chattahoochee River basin. The population of rock bass is considered the “least concern” on the IUCN red list. They are not considered an invasive species. Fishing for rock bass as a sport is managed by some rules and regulations, and artificial water systems are used to manage and maintain populations of rock bass. This is a freshwater fish that inhabit various bodies of water. This includes lakes, river systems, reservoirs, shore banks, ponds, weed beds, streams, and spring holes. These fish prefer cooler waters with plenty of rocks, hence their name “rock bass.” The water should ideally be rich in vegetation and covered with a rocky bottom. The water should ideally have low turbidity, so rocks, wooden branches, and vegetation should be plentiful as hiding places. The bottom of the water system should be filled with rocks or sand. These fish do not typically inhabit waters with silt. Their ideal current is slow-moving, and they avoid river areas with fast-moving currents. The main predators of young rock bass include northern pike, larger bass species, muskies, and walleye. Adult rock bass is generally more protected when they have a larger size. They are carnivorous fish that prey on smaller fish. In some cases, they may eat their own fry if there is insufficient vegetation and rocks to keep the fry safe. The main times that adults can be seen preying on food items are during the early mornings and evenings, and they are diurnal. They will eat a variety of smaller fish, including minnows, amphibians, zooplankton, and yellow merch, along with small crustaceans and insects and their larvae. They will also readily eat a variety of baitfish from the surface. The average lifespan for rock bass is between 8-10 years in the wild. Certain specimens can live longer, but it is uncommon for rock bass to live for more than 12 years. They can reproduce once sexually mature at 2-3 years old. They are polyandrous, which means that they mate with multiple fish during the spawning season. Females can lay more than 5,000 eggs during a single spawn, which occurs around April till the beginning of June in warmer water. Spawning occurs around rock bass nests, typically created close to each other. Males are responsible for building the nest, and they can become quite territorial during this time in efforts to protect the nest. Once spawning has occurred, the male will fan the eggs and protect the fry shortly after hatching. Not all fry enter adulthood, as rock bass sometimes eat their young or are eaten by predators. Rock bass is considered to be game fish, and they are popular for fishing. This fish enjoys a variety of bait such as wax worms, nightcrawlers, minnows, and other types of baitfish. The best way to catch one is to use artificial lures or live bait. A micro fishing rod and a fishing reel with a smooth drag are a good choice for catching them. These fish do not spend much time in the middle of the lake and prefer to school around the bank or shoreline of the water in vegetation and structures where they feel secure. They can be used in cooking, and they are edible. These fish can be pan-fried or baked, but ensuring the internal temperature is right before consumption is important. The flesh of the bass is described as flaky and white."

    "Name": "European Polecat",
    "Features": "Mask-like face markings",
    "Fun_Fact": "Its fur changes color in the winter!",
    "Text": "“The European polecat can interbreed with ferrets.” The European polecat is a small, slender mammal that is related to weasels , ferrets , and minks . Despite its diminutive size, it is a swift, fierce predator. The European polecat is native to Europe , North Africa , and parts of Asia . Once considered vermin and hunted to near extinction, the European polecat now enjoys a healthy population in most of its former range. The European polecat’s scientific name is Mustela putorius . The name polecat comes from the French term “poule chat,” which means “chicken cat.” The term refers to the fact that polecats would sometimes raid chicken coops for eggs and chicks. The polecat has a slender body, short legs, and a wide head. Small ears, a round nose, and bright eyes give this little guy an adorable look, but don’t be fooled. The polecat is a fierce fighter who will defend itself aggressively. The polecat has thick, glossy fur. Its colors are mostly deep brown to black with red patches and a yellow underbelly. It usually has a white patch around its nose and a raccoon-like mask around its eyes. One chief way to make the identification of a polecat is the way its fur changes. In summer, the fur gets lighter and thinner. In winter, the polecat’s coat gets thicker and shades to a silvery gray color. Compared to other members of the mustelid family, the polecat has exceptionally large, sharp teeth. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The European polecat is a solitary, nocturnal hunter. Some female polecats and young polecats may look for food in the daytime, but adults and males prefer to hunt at night. The polecat sets up a range of territory that it uses as a hunting ground. The size of this personal habitat can range from a small plot of land to a large spread that includes several dens. Some polecats use the abandoned dens of foxes and badgers instead of building their own. Despite this, the polecat is not strongly territorial. A polecat will often share its territory with other polecats, and it usually doesn’t mark its habitat with scent. A polecat is a quiet animal with few vocalizations. It may growl or squeak when frightened. The European polecat prefers to live near water sources. It can often be found near marshes, riverbanks, dunes, and coastal cliffs. Being close to water increases its food supply. Polecats are adaptable animals that can be found in wetlands , grasslands , agricultural land, prairies, and forests. European polecats use hedgerows for shelter and navigation. They also prefer to use existing nests rather than build their own. The polecat is a carnivore that eats voles , mice , and other rodents . It also eats lizards , frogs , and birds . If it can’t find its preferred prey, a polecat may supplement its diet with fruit and insects . A polecat’s diet can vary greatly. It changes according to what is available and the time of year. Scientists have seen European polecats eating the following: Despite its small size, the polecat can defend itself from larger predators. It uses its anal glands to produce a strong, unpleasant smell that wards off many predators. Large carnivores usually leave polecats alone for that reason. Most polecats are killed by cars. Other threats are habitat loss, especially hedge removal when forests are cleared. Polecats are sometimes trapped accidentally or poisoned by preying on rodents who have eaten poisons. The polecat’s breeding season is in winter. Polecats are polygamous, and both males and females reproduce with several mates. They reach sexual maturity when they’re a year old. There is no courtship or mating ritual. A male grabs a female by the neck and copulates with her. Male polecats are known as hobs, and females are known as jills. A pregnant female incubates the babies for 42 days and then gives birth to a litter of three to seven kits. The mothers feed and care for the kits until they are about 3 months old. Mother polecats are extremely protective of their young and will defend them aggressively against intruders. European polecats have a lifespan of six to 14 years in the wild. Their lifespan in captivity may be longer. Because of its extensive range of distribution, exact population numbers are unknown, but conservationists are concerned that the polecat’s population is decreasing. The European polecat is listed as “least concern” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) . It enjoys protected status in the United Kingdom . In the past century, polecats were considered vermin and were routinely killed by gamekeepers and farmers. That led to the near extinction of this species. Today, polecats have recovered their population numbers. Many people now appreciate their help in controlling rat populations. In the United Kingdom, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act and are a priority species under the U.K. Biodiversity Framework. The European polecat was once hunted as vermin. Today, farmers and gamekeepers appreciate the polecat’s help in controlling rodent populations. This masked bandit has recovered from the brink of extinction and now has a stable population."

    "Name": "Kokanee Salmon",
    "Features": "Reddish flesh",
    "Fun_Fact": "They change color in preparation for spawning!",
    "Text": "The kokanee salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) is a non-anadromous type of sockeye salmon. Alternate names for this fish include kokanee trout, silver trout, Kennerly’s trout, Kennerly’s salmon, little redfish, kikanning, and Walla. Like other Pacific salmon, it only spawns once and then dies, limiting its lifespan to four or five years. It inhabits land-locked freshwater lakes in the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan. The scientific name for kokanee salmon is Oncorhynchus nerka . The name is a mixture of Greek and Russian. Oncorhynchus derives from the Greek terms for “nail” and “snout” while nerka is the Russian word for anadromous sockeye salmon. Kokanee salmon are a type of sockeye that are non-anadromous, or land-locked. Unlike this species, most sockeye are migratory, moving upriver from the ocean to spawn. Kokanee comes from the Sinixt word kekeni , an Indigenous term for the land-locked form of sockeye. The species belongs to the class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) within the superclass Osteichthyes (bony fishes). Scientists further place it in the order Salmoniformes and the family Salmonidae, which contains 11 genera and 66 species of salmon. Sockeye, including kokanee, belong to the genus Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmon and trout) . Prior to spawning, kokanee salmon have steel blue to bluish-green heads and backs, silver sides, and silvery-white bellies. Unlike most other salmon and trout, they do not have dark spots on their backs, though they may have speckles on their dorsal fins. During spawning, males develop a hump and a hooked jaw with teeth (a “kype”). They also turn bright red with dark green heads and black snouts and jaws. Females undergo a similar change, though their colors are duller. The color change is a result of a diet rich in carotenoids, which are pigments responsible for bright red, orange, and yellow coloration in animals and plants. The bright red attracts potential mates, but it also makes these fish more vulnerable to predators. These land-locked fish are typically smaller than anadromous sockeye. This is likely due to a less robust food supply in lakes and rivers as opposed to marine environments. While sockeye can grow up to 33 inches long and weigh as much as 17 pounds, kokanee salmon usually measure no more than 12-15 inches. They can weigh between three to five pounds, though most individuals don’t exceed one pound. However, the largest kokanee on record according to the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) measured 27 inches in length and weighed an impressive 9.67 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This species has fine scales that arrange themselves in rings, which (much like the rings of a tree) can help determine an individual’s age. It also has six types of fins with eight individual fins in total: a dorsal fin, an adipose fin, a caudal fin, an anal fin, two pelvic fins, and two pectoral fins. Kokanee salmon inhabit land-locked areas of the United States, Canada, Russia , and Japan. Within the United States, they occur in a number of states including Alaska , Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Idaho, New York, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, New England, North Carolina, and Utah. In Canada, they inhabit British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon Territory. These fish spend their whole lives in cool lakes, typically swimming at depths of 15-90 feet, though some go deeper than this. At spawning time, they move closer to the shore or upstream into tributaries. The IUCN has not assessed the conservation status of kokanee salmon as of 2022. As of 2010, it lists sockeye salmon as Least Concern due to its stable populations. However, NOAA Fisheries lists sockeye populations in Lake Ozette (Washington) and Snake River (Idaho) as protected under the Endangered Species Act. The WWF warns of potential threats to other Pacific salmon species including climate change, poaching, habitat destruction, river blockages, and overharvesting. You can find a list of endangered species here . The ancient ancestors of kokanee salmon lived as far back as 65-95 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period. During this time, they underwent a significant autotetraploid event in which they developed twice the number of chromosome arms and DNA content. Scientists speculate that this resulted in greater diversity and faster evolution. By the early Miocene Epoch, approximately 15-20 million years ago, two genera within Salmonidae split from each other. The first genus, Salmo , comprises Atlantic salmon ; the other, Oncorhynchus , contains Pacific salmon. Oncorhynchus speciated throughout the Miocene, producing all extant species by six million years ago. Although fossils of Pacific salmon from the ensuing Pleistocene are rare, scientists speculate that northwestern North America’s active geologic history inspired greater diversity among Oncorhynchus than Salmo . It is possible that kokanee salmon came from lake-type sockeye rather than sea-type sockeye. The lake-type may have become land-locked at some point and evolved into its current non-anadromous form. Taxonomists currently debate whether or not kokanee and sockeye salmon belong to two different species. Though they often inhabit the same habitats during spawning season, the two types do not automatically mate with each other. Interestingly, one study in Skaha Lake, British Columbia introduced a sockeye population to a kokanee population and observed the hybrid spawn. It discovered that 92% of hybrid individuals were non-anadromous with 76% being the offspring of resident non-anadromous females. Some sockeye offspring have been known to become non-anadromous while some kokanee offspring have become anadromous. A unique subtype of kokanee, black kokanee , exists in Lake Saiko in Japan and the Anderson and Seton lakes in British Columbia. Some scientists consider the Japanese type to be its own species, Oncorhynchus kawamurae . These isolated populations on either side of the Pacific exhibit black nuptial coloration and spawn much deeper than most sockeye salmon, anywhere between 65-230 feet below the surface. The lack of shared mtDNA haplotypes or a monophyletic grouping suggests that the Japanese populations likely split from the Anderson-Seton populations during two different evolutionary episodes. This may correspond to the multiple proposed postglacial splits of regular kokanee from sockeye. Kokanee salmon are omnivores, though they prefer animal matter to plant matter. Because of their small size, they are restricted to diminutive prey and are themselves easy targets for a number of predators. Kokanee salmon eat zooplankton, aquatic insects, freshwater shrimp, and small plants. Since zooplankton are so tiny, these fish use comb-like gill rakers on their gills to separate miniscule organisms from the water. Chinook salmon are the primary predators of kokanee salmon along with other large fish like rainbow trout, char, sturgeon , and burbot. They are also the targets of bears, wolves, otters, osprey and bald eagles , not to mention humans. The risk increases dramatically during spawning season when both males and females turn a conspicuous red. Unlike sockeye, kokanee salmon do not migrate from the rivers of their birth to the ocean. Instead, they move to nearby lakes, where they spend four to five years growing and maturing. After this, they reach sexual maturity and are ready to spawn either in the lake shallows or upstream in tributaries. Like all Pacific salmon, they are semelparous, dying soon after spawning. Because of their mating habits, these fish live only four to five years. Typically in their fourth year, males and females make their way to the site of their birth during a period of time called a “run.” Runs occur between August and December depending on the location. The female digs a trench, or a “redd.” Other, subordinate males may be in attendance, though the dominant male will fight them off using his kype and hump. The female may also be aggressive toward them as well as other females. Once ready, the female and dominant male descend together into the redd. They gape and vibrate until they release eggs and milt (sperm). One female typically lays approximately 1,000 eggs, though she may lay more or less depending on the availability of food sources. The other males may also release their milt on her other side. The female covers the fertilized eggs as she digs a new redd just upstream in preparation to spawn again. Both males and females may mate with multiple partners. The eggs incubate for approximately 110 days, usually hatching in February or March. Newly-hatched alevins depend on attached egg-yolk sacs for nutrition for the first two to three weeks of life. Once they develop into fry and then juveniles, they move downstream to a nearby lake or into deeper waters to feed and grow. Kokanee salmon are popular recreational or sport fish, though other sockeye salmon are important to commercial fisheries. NOAA estimates the 2021 worldwide commercial catch for sockeye salmon at 272 million pounds with a total value of $459 million. The vast majority of sockeye comes from Alaska, though fisheries net smaller numbers off the West Coast, mainly around Washington and Oregon. Though they are great for canning, these fish are also good fresh or frozen. For this species, fisheries typically use gillnet purse seines or reef nets. Though kokanee salmon are small, they are aggressive and fight hard to free themselves, making them valuable to recreational and sport anglers. These fish travel in schools, making it possible to catch multiple fish in one session. They are active during the day but are likeliest to bite at dawn and dusk when the light is low. The best types of bait are pink maggots, dye-cured shrimp, or canned corn, though anglers should be careful not to overload their hooks. One or two pieces of bait per hook should be sufficient. Kokanee salmon flesh is soft, rich, and vibrantly red with a pleasant, relatively mild taste. Acceptable ways to cook kokanee salmon include grilling, roasting, frying, smoking, and baking. Check out this comprehensive guide to smoked kokanee or explore a number of methods for preparing this delectable fish. This recipe for herbed kokanee with roasted garlic and lemon butter is a great way to get started. This fish yields relatively lean meat much like that of sockeye flesh . Per 155 grams, it contains 261 calories, 39 grams of protein, and 10 grams of fat."

    "Name": "Bigfin Reef Squid",
    "Features": "Iridescent red and green colors that respond to light",
    "Fun_Fact": "Can change color through use of chromatophores",
    "Text": "Also known as the glitter squid or oval squid, the bigfin reef squid belongs to the loliginid squid family Loliginidae. They get their name from the large oval fin connected to the mantle. Although they rank as a medium-sized species and only measure around 1.5 to 13 inches long, they grow faster than almost any other large marine invertebrate. They engage in elaborate mating displays and live relatively short lives, with a maximum age of just 315 days. The bigfin reef squid goes by many other names, including the oval squid, glitter squid, and green-eyed squid. In Australia, people sometimes refer to it as the northern calamari. Its genus name, Sepioteuthis, derives from the Greek words sepia, meaning “cuttlefish,” and teuthis, or “squid.” This name references the similarities in appearance between the bigfin reef squid and another cephalopod, the cuttlefish . Like other members of their genus, bigfin reef squids feature characteristic oval fins through the mantle that distinguishes them from other squids. These fins extend anywhere from 83% to 97% of the mantle lengths and up to 70% of the mantle width. Due to these fins, people often mistake them for cuttlefish. The mantle appears cylindrical and tapers to a cone at the end. At its longest, the mantle can measure up to 15 centimeters long, with males typically measuring larger than females. Males typically weigh between 0.9 and 3.1 pounds, while females weigh from 0.3 to 2.3 pounds. Bigfin reef squids possess large eyes and strong, curved beaks. They have 2 tentacles as well as 8 arms of varying lengths. The arms measure thickest near the body and taper to a narrow point. Each arm possesses two rows of suckers, with each sucker measuring less than 2 millimeters wide and sporting a ring of sharp teeth. Living bigfin reef squids range in color, including translucent white, pale yellow, and brownish pink. Chromatophores cover the top of the head, mantle, and arms but not the underside of the fins. These chromatophores allow bigfin reef squids to rapidly change body color and patterns in a process called metachrosis. Additionally, they possess iridophores in the head, which produce iridescent red and green lights when exposed to light. Depending on their age, bigfin reef squids exhibit both shoaling and schooling behavior. Juvenile squids often swim together in groups, although not parallel to each other like some schooling fish . Also, unlike some other squids, adult bigfin reef squids rarely cannibalize one other. This allows squids of different sizes to swim together without the threat of larger members attacking and eating the smaller ones. In the presence of light, bigfin squids display intense phototactic responses. They will move close to the light and then stop all other movements. This behavior does not vary based on the color of the light, but stronger lights appear to generate a more powerful response. You will most likely encounter bigfin reef squids in warm, shallow water. They commonly inhabit depths up to 328 feet below sea level. Their preferred habitats include regions near shorelines, rocky outcroppings, and coral reefs, hence their name. The juveniles often congregate under driftwood or other obstructions to avoid predators, particularly during the daytime. Bigfin reef squids are carnivorous predators that eat various marine life. They often hunt at night and retreat to deeper waters to hide during the day. Their diet consists primarily of prawns , crustaceans, and fish. They use their tentacles to grab and their 8 arms to hold onto their prey while they eat. Their strong, curved beaks are immensely powerful and perfectly suited for tearing flesh or breaking shells. While they can eat once every few hours, they also go up to 24 hours between eating meals. Several species prey on bigfin squids, including marlin, tuna , swordfish, sharks , whales, and groundfish. They are most vulnerable during their larval stage when their small size makes them especially susceptible to predators. Bigfin reef squids rely on their camouflage skills and ink sacs to avoid and escape from predators, respectively. They also have rather acute hearing compared to most cephalopods, which allows them to detect nearby predators. Although adult bigfin reef squids rarely cannibalize one another, cannibalism frequently occurs among juveniles. In addition to predators, bigfin reef squids also serve as hosts for several marine parasites such as Doricicola similis, Dicyema koshidae , and Dicyema orientale. Although bigfin reef squids often spawn in May, they can mate and lay eggs year-round. They typically engage in two different posturing behaviors. The first is called “accentuated gonads,” in which the squid draws attention to its sexual organs by making its mantle translucent while the gonads appear bright white. The second method is often used by the males and is called spread arms. This tactic involves the squid tilting its body forward and spreading its arms widely, and most often occurs when a male pursues a prospective female mate. When mating, bigfin reef squids employ several approaches, most of which last for only a few seconds. Sometimes, a male may swim rapidly back and forth beside a female before quickly depositing his spermatophores inside the female’s mouth funnel. Smaller males may also sneak up on females while they court a larger male in the hopes of successfully mating while the females are distracted. Other times, males and females may swim together side by side until the male directly deposits his spermatophore into the female’s mantle cavity at the opening of the oviduct. Female bigfin reef squids can lay anywhere from 20 to 1180 eggs throughout their lives. They can lay eggs year-round and die shortly after spawning. The eggs are often attached to rocks, corals, plants, or other underwater surfaces. After incubating for around 3 weeks, the larval squids emerge. They develop rapidly and can exhibit complex color-shifting behavior shortly after birth that doesn’t develop until much later in most other squid species. Males reach sexual maturity at around 140 days, while females sexually mature between 156 and 196 days old. The oldest bigfin reef squid ever recorded lived a total of 315 days, which represents a relatively short lifespan compared to other squids. Due to their rapid growth rate and abundance, bigfin reef squids are among the most commercially popular squid species. Every year, fishers harvest millions of bigfin squids from the ocean through trawling, seine fishing, and net traps. While most abundant during full moons and in foggy weather, their populations remain stable year-round. This likely has to do with the fact that they do not breed seasonally, so populations are constantly replaced. Despite their increasing importance as a food source, their worldwide population remains stable. As a result, bigfin reef squids have become the subject of much debate concerning their viability for mariculture. The bigfin reef squid is the most popular species in the genus Sepio teuthis. You can find them throughout the temperate and tropical waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Their native range extends from the Hawaiian Islands to the Red Sea and from Japan to Australia and New Zealand. In recent years, their range has expanded to include parts of the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea. Given their fast growth rate, fecundity, and widespread distribution, bigfin reef squids are extremely prolific. Their abundance makes them extremely important to commercial fishing operations, and they are a popular food source for many cultures worldwide. Even though fishers collect millions of bigfin reef squids each year, their population shows no signs of decline. Still, the IUCN lists the bigfin reef squid as a Data Deficient species, as not enough information exists at this time to determine its conservation status."

    "Name": "Coopers Hawk",
    "Features": "Long tail and rounded wingtips",
    "Fun_Fact": "Eyes change color as they age",
    "Text": "“The Cooper’s hawk is the stealthy and agile aerial predator of the American woodlands.” Cooper’s hawk is a bird known by many different names throughout North America, including the chicken hawk, striker, and flying cross. It is a medium-sized hawk that is often identified by its proportionally large head, black-banded tail feathers, and hunting habits under the canopy of wooded or forested areas. Even expert observers can easily confuse the identification of these hawks with similar related American hawks like the sharp-shinned hawk and northern goshawk . They spend most of their time in the canopy of densely wooded areas where they use their remarkable agility to stalk and ambush elusive prey species. They mostly eat smaller birds, but can also prey on mammals and insects. Cooper’s hawk has many common or local names, including chicken or hen hawk, quail hawk, swift hawk, big blue darter, striker, and flying cross. The species’ scientific name is Accipiter cooperii and they are members of the Accipitridae family in the Aves class. The name “Cooper” and “cooperii” are both derived from the original name given to the species by a French ornithologist who discovered it in 1828. He named it after the American naturalist William Cooper, his friend and contemporary, who also traversed the Americas to collect sample specimens of various animal species. The Cooper’s hawk is a bird with several key physical characteristics that are all adapted to increase their maneuverability, agility and stealth. They have relatively short wings compared to their size, with an average wingspan of about 33 inches. Their wings have distinctly rounded tips. They have very long tail feathers relative to wingspan and body size, which helps them precisely control their movements as they navigate around trees and make sharp mid-air turns to keep up with smaller, evasive birds. The hawk also has a relatively large head as well as a strong beak and talons that help it achieve a firm grip on its prey. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This medium-sized species ranges from 14 to 20 inches in total length, but this doesn’t stop them from targeting birds of comparable size. The average weight for a mature bird ranges from 1 to 1.5 pounds, with females being routinely larger than their male counterparts. In the United States, birds found nesting west of the Mississippi River is generally smaller than those east of the river. Body feathers range in color but are usually brownish or bluish-gray on the back and wings with a much lighter underbelly. Darker barring is usually seen across the underside. Unlike falcons and many of the more active raptor species, Cooper’s hawk is a patient and prudent predator that spends a lot of its time waiting in woodland canopies. They watch and listen for potential prey stealthily, relying on their camouflaged feathers to conceal them in the branches of trees. They prefer to ambush their prey and take them by surprise, but they are capable of remarkable burst speed to make a capture. However, they are usually unwilling to engage in lengthy pursuits and may break off the chase if their prey keeps distance for long enough. This species is an early riser and is more active in the dawn and morning hours than the afternoon. They also spend a substantial portion of their time preening on their roost to keep their feathers in perfect condition as they wait for prey. While they spend most of their time among the upper branches of trees, they sometimes take to the ground to hunt smaller mammals or take a drink from a secluded water source. Like many predatory birds, this hawk rarely makes a call or sound except as a warning against threats. Cooper’s hawks hunt almost exclusively in wooded areas with a tendency to stick to deciduous and mixed forests. They have a strong preference for temperate climates and their native range extends from southern portions of Canada through the entire continental United States to the northern portions of Central America. While they may remain in their local environment year-round, birds that live in Canada and the northern US tend to migrate south annually. Their smaller wings and long tail feathers are adaptations that help them navigate around trees and chase unpredictable prey. While they are capable of short bursts of speed, their body isn’t suited for diving or long pursuits like those of many other raptor species. Their dark and barred coloration also provides effective camouflage among the branches and treetops where they spend much of their time. Cooper’s hawk is an opportunistic carnivore that targets live prey and has a decent range of possible targets. Reported cases of these hawks consuming carrion are extremely rare. They have a definite preference for certain types of bird species as prey, but their diet can become flexible when the need arises. With common names like the hen hawk, quail hawk, and chicken hawk, Cooper’s hawk has an obvious preference for eating chickens, quail, and other plump fowl. They have long been a scourge of farmers, especially in centuries past, who had to worry about these hawks targeting their coops. Bats are another likely prey candidate for this hawk, as are most small to mid-sized bird species. Snakes , frogs , and various land mammals, including squirrels and chipmunks , may also fall prey to hungry hawks. This hawk is generally near the top of the food chain in its local environment, with potential predators limited to eagles and other larger birds. One of the biggest historical threats to the Cooper’s hawk was the widespread use of pesticides. These toxic agents infiltrated the food chain and reached high concentrations for hawks, falcons , and other predatory animals. Limitations in the use of these pesticides have allowed for some rebound and they are considered a species of least concern in terms of conservation. The species is not a source of food for humans, but they were once considered a fair target for shooting by people who wanted to protect their domesticated animals and local game birds. This practice was popular in the first half of the 20th century but was curtailed when the dwindling hawk population prompted conservation laws protecting them. Even though active shooting is now a minimal concern, these hawks are still sometimes hunted or poisoned to defend poultry or fowl. Even though their overall population is relatively stable, the Cooper’s hawk currently faces the ongoing threat of habitat loss. Logging activities and general encroachment by human development are slowly limiting their local ranges and forcing them into lower-quality environments. They have adapted to urban and suburban habitats with some success, but researchers are unsure of the long-term consequences or viability of this transition. These hawks tend to have only one mate per season, like most predatory birds, but this isn’t always the case. Mature adults also tend to select prospective mates of comparable size and pairings of larger individuals typically lay their eggs a bit earlier in the year than smaller birds. Courtship rituals are flexible and may involve just the male, just the female, or both at the same time. Mutual sky circling is a common occurrence alongside sky dances that may include arching, flaring, and other displays. Breeding and nest building usually takes place between February and March . In most cases, both members of the pair remain with the nest to gather food and defend their young. The nests are generally bulky structures made from sticks, bark, and assorted greenery. Hawks defending the nest may make a “kek” call to warn their partner when they feel threatened by a potential predator. Females generally lay 3 to 5 eggs that have a bluish-white shell. Both genders participate in incubating the eggs for about 35 days before they hatch. The chicks remain in the nest for 4 to 5 weeks before they start learning to fly. Wild birds have a life expectancy of 8 to 10 years, with the highest risk of mortality in the first year. The oldest known specimen tracked by banding reached an age of 20 years and 5 months. Despite intense persecution by humans and population reduction from pesticide exposure in the 20th century, the Cooper’s hawk has made a strong comeback. Their numbers are now estimated to be between 100,000 and 1 million across their entire native range and conservationists believe this number is currently stable. However, the continued destruction of habitat and threats to the population of desirable prey species could cause problems for them in the years ahead."

    "Name": "Anole Lizard",
    "Features": "On most species, the brightly colored dewlap on the neck of the males",
    "Fun_Fact": "There are just under 400 species, several of which change color.",
    "Text": "The name Anole Lizard refers to one of over 400 species of mostly color-changing lizards located primarily in South and Central America. One of the most charming residents of the North American garden is the little green anole lizard. Curious and occasionally friendly, these bright green reptiles can be seen darting across deck rails and rearing their heads above flower pots. They hunt for moths among begonias and take flies for a snack with lightning-quick precision. There is a single species, the Green Anole, Anolis carolinensis , native to North America , which is sometimes called the American Chameleon. Though many anole lizards can exhibit color adaptations to their environment, the anole lizard differs from true Chameleons in many ways, not least in their very limited ability for color change. In most species, the male and female differ, most commonly because the males have a brightly colored dewlap on the necks, but males and females may also be characterized by size and sometimes nose length. Another species, the Brown Anole ( A. sagrei ), can be found in parts of the United States , but is considered an invasive species and has a negative effect on local ecosystems. A few other species, including the Knight Anole ( A. equestris ) are also found in Florida but are introduced species and not native to the area. Anoles come from the family Dactyloidae under the Class Reptilia. Because there are over 400 species, it would be impossible to list all their scientific names here. Collectively, they are called Anolis. Some of the subspecies are: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The size and color of each anole lizard species will differ depending on habitat, climate, and diet. Depending on where they live and how they hunt, they may have physical adaptations such as large hind legs for jumping large distances for prey, or short stubby legs if they live higher up in trees and creep up slowly on prey to avoid detection by their predators when hunting. They come in many colors, though the most common colors are a range of greens and browns, with yellow and sometimes blue variations. Most male anole lizards have a dewlap, which is a piece of erectile tissue on the neck, which can be collapsed and extended into a semi-oval shape. The dewlaps of the male can be almost any color, and usually, the color differs greatly from the lizard’s body. Anoles are mostly solitary. They may live near each other but are not generally found in groups. Males aggressively defend their territory during sexual maturity, otherwise, they are typically docile and tolerate humans to varying degrees. Various behavioral adaptations occur depending on the environment in which they live. Ancestors of the green anole lizard hail from Cuba, and long ago spread across the southeastern United States. These little green lizards are now sold in pet stores and have recently become the subjects of several evolutionary scientific studies. The evolution of animal species is often portrayed as a process that takes place over thousands of years – and that is often the case. But sometimes, as they say, needs must. The North American green anole offers an example of evolution at warp speed. It was a case of evolve or die. The green anole lizard is the only anole species native to the United States, and for most of their history, they have lived on or around the base of trees where insects abound. Someone brought brown anoles into the country in the 1950s, and those highly invasive lizards quickly began to drive the green anoles from the forest floor to higher branches. Rather than die out, the green anoles forged a new life in the trees and on higher ground. They became expert climbers and found new places to hunt. Amazingly, over a span of a mere 20 generations and 15 years, the green anoles evolved larger toe pads covered with more sticky scales to make climbing easier. According to scientists, this is a perfect example of “character displacement,” an evolutionary process that allows two closely related species to diverge and take advantage of separate niches. Other studies have proven that the resilient little lizards have evolved to tolerate colder temperatures after surviving extreme cold snaps in some states – while city anoles evolved stickier feet to make climbing up buildings easier. As a species, green anoles have learned to go with the flow to survive. Most anole lizard species live in or near trees, though some live near the base and some prefer the smaller limbs near the top. Their hunting styles will differ depending on their locations. Anole lizards may be found in bushes, reeds, low limbs, tree trunks, and forest canopies. They are found in many ecosystems, including on farms, in residential yards, in rainforests, dry forests, arid scrub, grasslands, and in riverside vegetation. Almost all anoles are insectivores, though some will also consume some vegetation and nectar. Anoles are hunters who feed primarily on insects , spiders, and other invertebrates , but may also consume nectar, tree sap, and occasionally rotted fruit. Larger species may consume smaller or baby lizards, snakes , and eggs. One threat to anoles is other anoles. For instance, when they share a habitat, Brown Anoles will eat Green Anoles and their eggs. They are also prey for larger reptiles and snakes, as well as many predatory birds and a few small mammals . Their color-changing abilities afford them some protection from predators, but they are vulnerable during mating when they increase their movements and show off brighter colors. Typically, when males reach sexual maturity, they will hunt for a mate by flexing their dewlap and sometimes doing what looks like push-ups. These pushups are also used as a show of strength to discourage other males from entering the mating territory. Both males and females are polyamorous, mating with multiple partners over their lifespans. Male anoles defend a singular territory so that they can have exclusive access to females that enter into or live within that territory. However, the females wander outside the territories and mate with other males also. When a mate is found, the female will lay one or two eggs after copulation, often every day through the mating season. A baby will hatch at about 0.75 inches in size. A baby anole will reach sexual maturity at about 18 months and have a lifespan of two (wild) to seven years (captive). Populations vary widely between species with Green Anoles being estimated at around 100,000 specimens or more and the Blue Anole so rare that it may be headed for extinction."

    "Name": "Uaru Cichlid",
    "Features": "Dark-colored patch on the side of their body",
    "Fun_Fact": "The color of the Uaru cichlid changes during the spawning season",
    "Text": "The color of the Uaru cichlid changes during the spawning season . Uaru cichlid is a freshwater fish native to the Upper Orinoco and the Amazon basins in South America. The fish is popular for its unique triangular shape and coloring, unlike any other fish in the cichlid family. Although native to South America , you can find Uaru species in aquariums all over the world. The Uaru is a genus of small to medium-sized cichlid fish native to the blackwaters and whitewaters of South America. The name “ Uaru ” is the local Amazonian word for toad. The Uaru fishes have a number of nicknames. The native name of this fish is Waroo. People call them “triangle cichlids” in reference to the triangular shape of the adult and “chocolate cichlid” (a name it shares with Hypselecara temporalis, another species of cichlid fish) . The Uaru belongs to the order Cichliformes, which includes two families. The cichlid family is the largest in this order and one of the largest vertebrate families. There are more than 202 genera in this family, with about 1,700 species identified so far. The Uaru genus lives naturally in the wild in South America. Hobbyists also keep them as pets in aquariums all over the world. This genus has two main species: Uaru amphiacanthoides and Uaru fernandezyepezi . The Uaru has an oval disc-shaped body typically of cichlids. However, the row of the spine in the fish’s dorsal fin gives it a more triangular shape. This is why people call it the triangular cichlid. The Uaru has a long anal fin which is nearly as long as the rest of the fish’s body. The long anal fin makes it a powerful swimmer. Uaru species demonstrate different coloration depending on their age. Juvenile fish are often a bland color with a mottled pattern. This dull coloration is an important camouflage that helps to protect this fish. The color makes them look like dead leaves, so larger fishes ignore them. As the fish matures, the color turns from a subdued gray-brown to yellowish color. It may also have small brown blotches. The eyes of large mature fishes are typically bright yellow with black pupils. The fish typically has a large tear-shaped black mark running across the lower end of their body, as well as a smaller mark at the base of the tail. The mark can be distinct or subdued from one individual to the other. Uaru species have scaly bodies. However, the small size of these scales makes the fish’s body smooth and leathery. The small size of these scales gives their body a smooth and leathery appearance. In its natural habitat, the Uaru can grow to lengths of up to 12 inches, but it only grows to about 10 inches in a tank. Adult Uaru changes color just before spawning season. The color of their entire body becomes darker, with a bit of brown coloration along the edges. Their yellow eyes also become reddish, giving the fish a fiercer appearance. Uaru cichlid is native to South America. The two species in this genus have varying ranges and distributions. Uaru amphiacanthoides are found in the clear streams of the Amazon Basin in Northern Brazil and Guyana. Uaru fernandezyepezi, on the other hand, is found in the Orinoco Basin in Venezuela and Colombia . In the wild, this freshwater fish is mainly found in blackwaters and whitewaters. As a popular fish in the aquarium trade, this fish is also bred in captivity. It is best kept in a large, roomy aquarium with gravel or sand as a substrate . The tank is typically decorated with roots and bogwood. Since they’re raised in home and commercial aquariums, Uarus are not at risk of extinction. It is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN red list, which means the population is relatively stable and not under threat. Fishes are the first vertebrates to have ever evolved. The ancestors of modern fishes first appeared about 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion . The earliest fishes were primitive filter-feeders. It wasn’t until the Late Ordovician that the first fishes with defined jaws appeared. They became more widespread during the Devonian, which is commonly referred to as the “age of fishes.” The ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii) evolved about 420 million years ago. They’re the dominant vertebrate group today. Within this group, the family Cichlidae is the biggest and most diverse. They arose within the order of Cichliformes about 100 to 80 million years ago. Cichlids are renowned for their rapid evolutionary radiation and diversity across different habitats. There are several instances of their lineage evolving the same traits and even reversion to ancestral traits within the family. The Uaru is an omnivore, which means it eats anything from small fish, shrimps , worms, and aquatic plants. Uarus don’t have a lot of natural enemies. They are mostly threatened by humans, who catch them for food. They are also preyed on by other bigger fishes within their ecosystem. In its natural habitat, the Uaru cichlid is an omnivore that eats crustaceans, insects , detritus, worms, fruits, and plants. In home aquariums, the fish is not a picky eater. It can be fed with frozen bloodworms, live earthworms , black worms, frozen brine shrimps, blanched lettuce, and peas. Both male and female Uaru cichlids appear very similar to one another. This makes it difficult to distinguish between them. They reach maturity between five and six months and then move in pairs to mate. During the breeding season, their appearance changes to a darker color with coppery red eyes. The female produces between 100 and 400 eggs and lays on a flat rock surface for the male to fertilize. The pair (male and female) take turns guarding the eggs against predators. Males eat non-viable eggs. However, in some cases, they may end up eating the entire clutch. The Uaru eggs hatch within five days and are then moving to a shallow nest by their parents, feeding them with secretions from their skin for a week. Once the fry starts swimming, they become independent of their parents. However, the fry still stays close to the parent. The average lifespan of the Uaru cichlid is between 8 and 10 years. Uaru fishes are native to South America, especially in the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers. They are not endangered and are relatively common in their native habitat. Natives consider them important food fish. It is mainly kept as a pet in other regions of the world. They are mostly sold in pet stores and can also be purchased online."

    "Name": "Golden Tortoise Beetle",
    "Features": "Metallic gold elytra",
    "Fun_Fact": "Golden tortoise beetles have a metallic gold color which can change to dull brown when disturbed.",
    "Text": "The golden tortoise beetle is a species of insect in the leaf beetle family, known for its striking gold color. They have rounded, domed bodies, similar to that of ladybugs . This beetle has a unique ability to change the shade of its pigmentation from bright to dull gold using microscopic cavities in its cuticle. When threatened, the beetle presses its body close to the leaf surface, then tucks its appendages underneath its body like a tortoise . Golden tortoise beetles are herbivores, feeding on plants in the Convolvulaceae family. The golden tortoise beetle is an insect species in the leaf beetle family (Chrysomelidae). This group consists of more than 37,000 species of fully herbivorous beetles grouped into 2500 genera. This makes them one of the most commonly encountered beetles. This beetle is sometimes referred to as goldbug. The golden tortoise beetle species – Charidotella sexpunctata – contains one subspecies, Charidotella bicolor . Both are considered golden tortoise beetles. They’re native to the Americas and are mostly found in the United States , Canada , and Mexico . The goldbug is one of the few bugs in the world with a fully gold-colored body. They belong to a subfamily of insects known as tortoise beetles. This group of beetles is characterized by a wing covering (elytra) that extends to the side of their body, long enough to cover their legs, hence the name tortoise beetle. Goldbugs have round and domed bodies. They are similar to lady beetles in shape and size. Of course, they differ significantly from ladybugs in color and behavior. Like other tortoise beetles, adult golden beetles are characterized by expanded elytra that cover their head and appendages. The margins of the extended wing cover are not golden like the rest of their body. Instead, it is transparent and has a glass-like appearance. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These beetles are fairly small. They typically measure between 5 to 7 millimeters in length. Their most distinctive feature is their shiny, metallic gold color which earned them their common name and nickname, goldbug. Although they’re known for their bright golden color, golden tortoise beetles don’t always maintain this color. Their color changes as they grow, when they’re mating, or when they’re disturbed. Scientists are not certain of the mechanisms for this color change, but it is believed to be due to changes in the microscopic particles on their cuticles. Some theories also suggest that the color change is due to their ability to withdraw or introduce moisture to the surface of their exoskeleton. They can dull their bright metallic sheen, turning the lovely gold color to a brown or reddish brown. When the insect dies, the metallic gold color fades. The golden tortoise beetle is native to the Americas. They mostly live in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In places they live, they’re mostly found in association with plants in the family Convolvulaceae, their primary host. Adults emerge during the winter, but the beetles usually move to the host plant around spring. The field bindweed ( Convolvulus arvensis ) is typically their early season host. Later, they move to other plants, like the sweet potato and morning glories. Mostly found in fields and gardens, goldbugs rarely venture indoors. Many gardeners prefer to keep them around because of their striking appearance. Like all leaf beetles, golden tortoise beetles are fully herbivorous. They’re one of several tortoise beetles that feed on garden vines. Both adult and larvae forms of this insect feed on plants, leaving unsightly holes on the leaf surface. Plants in the Convolvulaceae family are their only food source. This includes morning glories, bindweed, and sweet potatoes. They do not form large swarms, and the damage they leave behind is mild. Most plants recover fully. Parasitic wasps of the genus Tetrastichus and the parasitoid fly, Eucelatoriopsis dimmocki , prey on goldbugs. Several ladybug species also prey on the larvae of this beetle. Damsel bugs, assassin bugs , shield bugs, and other insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts may prey on the larvae of golden tortoise beetles. Although the larvae carry a shield made from waste products and dead skin to deter prey, it is only effective against small predators. Golden tortoise beetles don’t occur as major infestations. Hence, they’re hardly a concern for gardeners; however, if you prefer to keep them away, you should keep your garden free from weeds and make sure you care for your plants properly. This will help prevent various pests, including goldbugs. Since they’re quite conspicuous, you can remove the beetles by hand. This is the easiest way to handle small infestations. You can also mix an organic spray using two tablespoons of neem oil , one tablespoon of dish soap, and a gallon of water. Spray this on your plants to get rid of small clusters of the beetles. Goldbugs have a lot of natural enemies. These include aldrich flies, burks, and several species of ladybugs, such as damsel bugs and assassin bugs. You can release them into your garden to get rid of the larvae of this beetle. Chemical insecticides should only be a final resort, if any of the organic control measures don’t work."

    "Name": "Dwarf Boa",
    "Fun_Fact": "Some species can change color from dark to light, and back again.",
    "Text": "Dwarf boas can be a fantastic option for those who want a snake, but not a behemoth. Boa species range from truly tiny to gargantuan, and some of the most beautiful species are gentle and calm, making them great pets – if you have the space. However, many of us don’t have enough space or the desire to have a buddy help us handle our 14-foot pet boa. Meet the dwarf boas. They can be of a naturally occurring smaller locality of Boa imperator , one of the Tropidophiidae dwarf boas, or a species that was bred to be smaller for owners who want the boa experience without the bulk. Boas, which are nonvenomous constrictor snakes, can be encountered in tropical regions of Central and South America. Similar to their anaconda relatives, they possess exceptional swimming abilities. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . However, they tend to favor terrestrial habitats and predominantly reside in hollow logs and deserted burrows previously occupied by mammals. The dwarf boa is a member of the Tropidophiidae family and inhabits the elevated cloud forests in northeastern Ecuador. This species stands out due to its possession of a “vestigial pelvis,” a feature commonly observed in primitive snakes. Some experts interpret this characteristic as evidence supporting the theory that snakes evolved from lizards that gradually lost their limbs over an extensive span of time. Those dwarf boas that were bred down in size are fairly easy to find from breeders. They tend towards the expensive end of the hobby, as they were specially bred for size, but they’re excellent choices for those who want a big snake that won’t get too big. Naturally occurring dwarf boas, such as those found in the Tarahumara region of Mexico, the Islands near Panama, and other areas. Some are being captive-bred in the U.S., so finding one of these for your next snake pet is possible without taking one from the wild. Often, these snakes live in areas where small sizes were rewarded by nature. It’s usually caused by limited prey and a lack of appropriate cover. The Boa look-alikes from the Tropidophis genus aren’t as readily available. Plus, given that many are endangered or threatened in nature, their focus should be on preserving those species. They also tend to be more delicate than their larger dwarf cousins. These snakes generally inhabit areas of South America and the West Indies; most species spend their day either hidden under vegetation or burrowed underground. They only surface at night and when it rains. A few arboreal species hide in the bromeliads that grow on trees. Dwarf boas aren’t one species of snake, they’re a class of boas and boa-like snakes that stay smaller than you expect from a boa. There are types of dwarf boas, we list a few here: This is what many people mean when they’re talking about dwarf boas. These are true boas that stay small because of the ecological niche that they inhabit in the wild. Corn Island boas, Caulkers Cay, Crawl Cay, Belize Mainland, and Hog Island boas are all subgroups of Boa Imperator . They aren’t generally considered subspecies, although some could possibly qualify. This species typically grows much larger – sometimes as long as 14 feet. However, because the prey is scarce, or the hiding spaces are small, only the small survive in their environment. Sometimes, when brought into a pet situation, a dwarf locality gets much bigger than expected. Why? Well, when you have a growing reptile that’s been accustomed to a particular amount of food, its body adjusts to that. It grows to fit its environment. Now, remove it from that environment and give it more food and better habitat. It’s going to get bigger than it would have in its native habitat, which makes the husbandry of these dwarf boas more challenging than that of other boas. These snakes happened to carry a dwarfism gene that a breeder decided to explore. They’ve become popular because they naturally stay much smaller than their “standard” cousins (and even some of the dwarf locality boas). These snakes typically only reach about 4-6 feet and look like a smaller version of the regular B. imperator or B. constrictor. At one point, this family was included in the Boidae family because they look like boas, but newer research indicated they are more closely related to false coral snakes than boas. So, out of the Boidae, and into Tropidophidiiae they went. There are two genera in this family and 19 species between them. They’re very secretive and difficult to observe. A few are in zoos but because they’re not as flashy as say, a rainbow boa or an anaconda these little guys just don’t get the public play that the true boas get. Many Tropidophis genus snakes have been assessed by IUCN and found to be Vulnerable or Endangered, but a few are classified as Least Concerns. One or two haven’t been seen in over 100 years and are assumed extinct. The highly secretive nature of the genus makes them exceedingly difficult to study. The dwarf boas bred deliberately by breeders aren’t out in nature, so there’s no assessment available. These snakes are strictly pet-trade animals, and that’s a beautiful thing – it allows snake lovers to have a boa in a small package and doesn’t deplete the wild population. The locality dwarfs, though – now there’s a good question. You could think of localities as nature’s version of a morph because they’re shaped by their environment. At this point, most locality boas have either been studied or are being studied and conservation is helping their population, like the Hog Island Boa. IUCN doesn’t list any of them as separate species from Boa constrictor , but some localities are endangered because of pet trade exportation and habitat destruction. There are a couple of locality dwarf boas from the Solomon Islands, they belong to the Candoia genus. These snakes are pretty stocky and spend a lot of time on the ground; they’re bred in captivity, but quite expensive when you find them. Because of the wide variety of dwarf boas both available as pets and out in the wild, the descriptions vary significantly. Even dwarf boas tend towards being heavy-bodied and muscular. However, due to their overall size, they’ll be a bit thinner than typical boa constrictors. Some species change color from night to day, becoming darker and lighter. These snakes are nonvenomous constrictors that grab prey with rear-pointing teeth and squeeze until the prey’s heart stops. Then, they swallow it whole. The Tropidophis genus dwarf boas are much more slender and fragile. Many of them change color depending on the time of day, and can even bleed voluntarily from the eyes, nostrils, and mouths when threatened. A dwarf boa isn’t as difficult or dangerous to handle as a full-size red-tailed boa because it’s small. Its teeth may make you bleed, but otherwise, you won’t suffer any ill effects from a bite. The wonderful part of any of the dwarf boa species is that they are small enough to handle relatively easily, they move slowly enough that you’re not going to be chasing it off across the yard, and they’re nonvenomous. Dwarf boas are relatively easy to handle. They’re not aggressive snakes, but some boas can be more prone to biting than other snake species. Like many animals, each snake has a different personality; they even have different moods. Dwarf locality boas from the Boa and Candoia genera make pretty good pets – if you are willing to take the time and money required to create a great habitat for them, proper feeding amounts, and learn to read their moods."

    "Name": "Onager",
    "Features": "black dorsal stripe with white borders",
    "Fun_Fact": "An onager's coat changes color with the season.",
    "Text": "An onager’s coat changes color with the season. If you are a keen reader of historic texts and literature, you might have come across the mention of the onager. Previously used as beasts of burden, onagers were once domesticated, but now, they live in the wild. They bear a remarkable resemblance to donkeys, and it would take a trained eye to tell them apart. Two subspecies of the onager are extinct and the species is near threatened. Onager is a name that comes from the Greek words onos meaning “ donkey ” and agrios meaning “wild.” Scientifically, the onager is known as Equus hemionus. The generic name Equus is Latin for “horse” while the specific name is a compound word derived from Greek hemi and onos meaning “half donkey.” Onagers are also called hemiones or the Asiatic wild ass. Members of the genus Equus are odd-toed ungulates, which refers to animals with hoofs, and they have oval-shaped hoofs. Other animals that belong to this genus are horses and zebras. The onager consists of five subspecies with the Mongolian wild ass as the nominate subspecies. The European wild ass and the Syrian wild ass are both extinct subspecies. The name Onager is commonly used only for the Persian onager whose subspecific name is onager, but it is actually the name of the entire species. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Onagers belong to the genus Equus which houses every living equine. The oldest known equine fossil found in Idaho comes from Equus simplicidens and is described as resembling a zebra but with the head structure of a donkey. Onagers have existed for over four million years, being among the oldest Equus species to diverge from their most recent common ancestor followed by the African zebra. Many ancient literary works mention onagers. They were domesticated thousands of years ago and originally used as beasts of burden. However, human beings never managed to completely tame these wild creatures and so they were replaced by the horse , donkey , and mule . Onagers are a species of wild asses. They have a short mane, large ears, and pale hair that changes color depending on the season. In the summer, they become reddish-brown, and this changes to yellowish or grayish-brown in the winter. The onager’s winter coat gets longer and coarser as well. Commonly misidentified with donkeys , onagers are much larger than donkeys. They weigh up to 440 to 640 pounds and are 6.9 to 8.2 feet in length and 4.9 feet at the shoulder. Also, onagers look more horse-like than donkeys. Another distinguishing feature between donkeys and onagers is a black stripe with a white border that runs down the middle of the onager’s back. Onagers have white rumps, bellies, and muzzles. Onagers are crepuscular animals with activity levels peaking during dusk and early in the morning at dawn when the weather is cooler and lowering when the sun is out. Although onagers can get their required daily amount of water from their food alone, they prefer to live near a reliable water source. This comes in handy, especially for lactating mothers who need a consistent supply of water. Onagers are a migrating species and make large migratory hikes that cover up to 15 square miles annually. Onagers are also very social animals that practice polygamy. They live in groups of about 10 to 12 members. The group usually includes a male onager (jack), a group of females (jennets), and their offspring. Onagers tend to form much bigger groups during fall and winter when and where resources are abundant and this herd can swell to sizes of 300 to 1,200 individuals. This herd is not uniform and is made up of several autonomous groups that break off after a short while in the herd. Older jacks are usually solitary. When threatened by a predator, onagers defend themselves as most equids do and work together to kick powerfully at their assailant and chase them away. When it comes to their relationship with people, this species is infamously difficult to tame. They are quite a stubborn species. Onagers are herbivorous and folivorous animals. Their diet consists primarily of perennial grasses, and they also forage for herbs, fruit, leaves, and, in more arid climes, trees and shrubs. They are also known to feed on tree bark. Onagers tend to live very close to water bodies. When water is lacking, they dig holes into dry riverbeds to reach water near the surface. In the colder months, onagers have been seen eating snow as a source of water. They get their required liquid intake from the food they consume. Onagers live in arid, temperate, and cold regions of Asian countries including China , Iran , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , India , Mongolia, and Israel . These equids inhabit grasslands , shrublands, desert plains, oases, steppes, mountain steppes, and the savanna. The onager subspecies prefer to reside in different habitats. You can find this Mongolian wild ass in the deserts and grasslands of Mongolia and northern China. They are the most widespread onager subspecies, but their population is dwindling due to poaching and habitat loss. They are extinct now in Kazakhstan and some regions in China and Siberia . As its name suggests, the Indian wild ass inhabited the arid regions and desert steppes of northwest India and Pakistan . However, now, 4,500 individuals are located in Gujarat, living in wildlife sanctuaries. The Turkmenian kulan prefers to live in cold and hot deserts. You can find this subspecies in Turkmenistan and returning to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan through reintroduction. The rare Persian onager likes to reside in desert and semidesert regions of Turkmenistan and northeastern Iran. This subspecies was decimated by the loss of habitat, resource competition with domestic livestock, and poaching. About 600 to 700 government-protected Persian onagers are left in the wild and less than 100 in captivity worldwide. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species , the Persian onager is an endangered species with only about 790 individuals in total remaining. The onager species is Near Threatened on the protection list with only about 28,000 onagers worldwide. The onager species is currently extinct in Jordan , Syria, some parts of Siberia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Palestine. Onagers reach sexual maturity at two years old but they don’t typically start mating until they reach three to four years of age. These animals practice polygyny, where one male mates with multiple females in one season. They do this in two main ways. Firstly, dominant onager males typically guard territories that are abundant in resources such as food and water. Then, the females wander between these guarded areas to mate with them. In the other mating method, a dominant male mates with the females in his harem and breeds with them. Mating season takes place from April through to September, peaking in the summer months of June and July. Gestation usually lasts 11 months and the female onager gives birth for a bit over ten minutes to usually one foal. Onager foals are precocious and can stand up with little to no help and nurse just 15 to 20 minutes after given birth to. These foals reach full independent age at one to two years of age. Onagers can live a plentiful life of 14 years in the wild and up to 26 years in captivity. Equids such as onagers usually have a long list of natural predators that hunt them. The onagers in Iran are prey to Persian leopards and striped hyenas . In India, mugger crocodiles are on the hunt for migratory onagers. Asiatic lions , tigers , Asiatic cheetahs , and bears also prey on them. Presently, gray wolves are the primary predator of onagers. Apart from predation, onagers also face the following threats: The onager is a protected species in most of the countries it inhabits and many breeding programs have been set up to ensure that the onager has a future. It is currently being reintroduced to some of its native territories."

    "Name": "Keyhole Cichlid",
    "Fun_Fact": "When these fish feel stressed, their skin color will change from yellow-cream to brown.",
    "Text": "Native to South America, keyhole cichlids are freshwater fish that live in slow-moving bodies of water covered in thick vegetation. They are primarily found in coastal streams, tributaries, and river basins. Venezuela’s lower Orinoco basin is home to where many of the keyhole cichlids live. Scientifically known as Cleithracara maronii , the Keyhole cichlid belongs to the family Cichlidae . Their name originates from the distinctive keyhole pattern on their body. The most distinctive feature of this fish is the black keyhole mark on its upper flank. This secondary marking is located on the fish’s face, which displays a black vertical line that extends across the head and passes through the eye. Their body consists of yellow-cream colored scales; however, different keyhole fish species have different fin colors. Additionally, with age, keyhole cichlids’ coloring lightens. The dorsal and anal fins of keyhole cichlids are long and slender. They differ from other cichlid species by having rounded foreheads and oval-shaped bodies. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The species of this fish is found in Central and South America. It has a wide distribution, ranging from the Atlantic coast of Panama to the Amazon River basin in Brazil. It is a freshwater fish that inhabits slow-moving rivers, streams, and lakes. The population of the keyhole cichlid fish is considered stable; unfortunately, it’s threatened by habitat destruction and pollution. This fish species prefers to live in shallow, murky waters in areas with plenty of vegetation. It is a carnivore that feeds on insects, crustaceans , and small fish. In the wild, the keyhole cichlid predators include larger fish, such as the piranha and birds of prey. Other potential predators include snakes, caimans, and other aquatic animals. In addition, the keyhole cichlid is also preyed upon by other fish, such as the oscar and the discus. To protect itself against certain predators, the keyhole cichlid will hide in rocks and crevices and use its bright colors to blend in with its surroundings. These fish reproduce by laying eggs on a flat rock or a hard surface . The male is responsible for providing a suitable location so the female can lay her eggs. The female will lay up to 500 eggs, which the male guards until these eggs hatch. During this time, the male will fan the eggs with his fins to keep these eggs oxygenated and free of debris. The eggs will then hatch within a few days, and both parents will take care of the young fish (now called fry) until they can swim and look for food. After this stage, the male will no longer guard the fry, and the female will take over caring for them. The lifespan of the keyhole cichlid is usually between 5-10 years. However, they are a hardy species and can live longer with proper care. This sought-after fish is known to put up a good fight, so it is essential to use the correct tools and bait to catch these intelligent fish. The keyhole cichlid has a taste for white bread, worms, shrimp, and minnows ; use these ingredients as bait. And, of course, invest in a hardy spinning reel, as these fish come with great force. Fishing the keyhole cichlid is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and experience the thrill of the catch. This colorful fish is a popular choice for freshwater anglers and can be found in many parts of the world. As for cooking this tasty fish, it’s a great staple to a delicious meal. This fish is an excellent option for those looking for a unique flavor and texture. Not only is it a healthy choice, but it is also easy to prepare. With just a few simple ingredients such as prawns, spinach, peas, garlic, juice of an orange, and spirulina powder, you can create a flavorful dish that will be sure to please. If you are looking for something new and exciting, add this fish to your culinary repertoire. The population of this fish found in the wild is stable, as It is not considered to be threatened or endangered. Furthermore, this popular aquarium fish is a peaceful species well-suited to a community tank, making these fish a popular choice for aquarists."

    "Name": "Gray Tree Frog",
    "Features": "Changes color based on temperature and environment",
    "Fun_Fact": "This frog can freeze itself by making glycerol that becomes glucose, which acts like antifreeze and stops its heartbeat and breathing!",
    "Text": "The gray tree frog can vary its color to match its environment and appear gray, green, and brown! The gray tree frog is a large species of tree frog that can take on many colors despite its name. It is commonly found in southeastern Canada and the eastern United States . The gray tree frog spends most of its life high up among the trees and is very adept at navigating the branches thanks to its sticky feet. The gray tree frog’s scientific name is Hyla versicolor , which is derived from the Latin for “variable color” due to its ability to alter the color of its skin based on certain factors, such as being a lighter shade at night and a darker tone during the day. It belongs to the Hylidae Family and Amphibia Class. Other common names for the gray tree frog are the eastern gray treefrog, northern gray treefrog, common gray treefrog, and tetraploid gray treefrog. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Genetic studies have shown that the gray tree frog evolved due to “multiple hybrid events” involving ancestors that have two sets of chromosomes. The species has been found to have DNA from Cope’s gray tree frog ( H. chrysoscelis ) and two other species that are now extinct but most likely were present in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the gray tree frog’s range. These frogs are almost indistinguishable from the Cope’s gray tree frog. The Cope’s gray tree frog has the same appearance as the gray tree frog and can only be identified by a slightly slower call. They are otherwise completely separate species, with the gray tree frog having twice as many chromosomes as the Cope’s gray tree frog. It’s uncertain how the gray tree frog evolved to be able to change color. Although it may seem like a chameleon in its abilities to adapt its color to match its environment in order to evade predators or as a reaction to the time of the day and related temperatures, there are several differences between the two animals. Apart from the frog being an amphibian and the chameleon a reptile, chameleons can change to a broader range of colors (including pink, orange, red, yellow, and blue), differing degrees of brightness, and combinations of tones. The chameleon is also faster at its color changes than the gray tree frog, and there are other reasons besides camouflage for it to shift shades such as for social signaling. These frogs are particularly unique because they are not necessarily always gray. Instead, their color variation can range from gray to green or even brown. It truly depends on its current environment and activities. It regularly alters its color to match tree bark, but its belly is usually always white. The gray tree frog is very warty in appearance. These frogs utilize a special grip on their hands and feet that allows them to climb vertically or horizontally with ease on trees and other objects. They are considered a larger example of a tree frog , being anywhere from 1.25 to 2.25 inches long depending on the sex. So on average, the frog is about three-and-a-half times as long as an aspirin tablet. Compared to other tree frogs, like the pinewood tree frog and squirrel tree frog, the gray tree frog has a weightier build. Two distinct features of adult frogs are the light spot beneath the eye and the bright orange coloration on the inner thigh. This bright color variation probably serves as a warning to potential predators. These frogs are solitary creatures and only spend time together during the breeding season. All other times of the year, they spend time hiding during the day and hunting during the night. During the day, they can be found disguising themselves under bark, rotten logs, leaves, and tree roots. It produces a sticky fluid from the tips of its hands and feet that allow it to climb into trees to hunt for food. The male of the species has a loud and almost birdlike call. It will make this call for hours after dusk as a way to establish a breeding territory. The males can be aggressive, but generally only in the breeding season when they need to defend their territory. They hibernate in the winter thanks to an adaptation that allows 80% of their body to freeze. They can survive extremely cold temperatures by hiding under rocks and other forest objects. These frogs are common in the eastern part of the United States and parts of southeastern Canada . This includes northern Florida over to central Texas, as well as all of South Carolina and Georgia. Being tree frog , they can usually be found in wooded areas, whether that is a forest or agricultural area. They will not be found far away from either trees or a source of water, like a swamp or pond. They spend most of their time in high treetops but can be identified in the vegetation of fishless wetlands during their breeding season. In the summertime, it is not unusual for people to see them on windows looking for the bugs attracted to artificial lights. This species of tree frog mainly feeds on different types of insects , such as snails , spiders , beetles , and the larvae of those insects. It spends most of its days high in treetops, where it can easily find moths , tree crickets, ants , flies , beetles , plant lice, spiders , and mites. It is comfortable jumping between branches to seek out its prey. They are opportunistic and will eat smaller frogs if given a chance. These frogs are very common and probably have a large population. However, regional populations in both the United States and Canada have to deal with the threats of habitat loss, water pollution, invasive species, and chytrid fungus. Different species of snakes , birds , small mammals , and even other frogs prey on these frogs. They spend most of their lives in the treetops to avoid these types of predators. They are also nocturnal and active at night to avoid predation. A known threat to these frogs is pesticides and insecticides that they consume on insects. These chemicals may have harmful long-term effects. The breeding season occurs after the frog wakes up from hibernation, in late spring and early summer. Males will defend an area around a water source and call out after dusk to find potential mates. Females will lay eggs in masses at the surface following mating. Each female will lay somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 eggs in batches of 10 to 40. The eggs hatch between 3 and 7 days. Young frogs are called tadpoles and live in the pond or water source they were hatched in until they are 4 to 8 weeks old. Then they complete a metamorphosis process and become young gray tree frogs or froglets. The frog’s lifespan is believed to be on average 7 to 9 years. This lifespan is similar for males and females. These frogs are known to be widely distributed across their habitat in the U.S. and Canada . However, there are no accurate counts of its population in any region. These frogs are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Most scientists believe there to be a large population that is generally not in danger of extinction any time soon."

    "Name": "Giant Desert Centipede",
    "Features": "Changes color to warn predator",
    "Fun_Fact": "They are the largest centipede in North America",
    "Text": "The Giant Desert Centipede is the largest centipede in Northern America. The Giant Desert Centipede is only found in two major regions but it is known by different names around the world. It is often mistaken for the Desert Centipede, which is a relative, but they both have distinct features that are different from each other. Giant Desert Centipede is referred to as the Scolopendra heros in the scientific world. Its origin is Latin, and it was named by Girard in 1853. It belongs to the order Scolopendromorpha and the family Scolopendridae. The species has a lot of different names like Giant Desert Centipede, Giant Sonoran Centipede, Texas Redheaded Centipede, and Giant Redheaded Centipede. There are more than 8,000 species of centipede in the world but, the population size of the Giant Desert Centipede is yet to be known. They are venomous centipedes, which are the largest in North America . Their population is restricted to only Mexico and some parts of the United States . Although their population is limited, they do not have any special conservation status. They only have one species, named the Giant Desert Centipede. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Around 12 to 60 eggs are laid by a female in one reproductive cycle. They remain in clusters in concealed spaces, under protection from the female Giant Desert Centipede. The females usually lay these eggs in either autumn or summer. She stays on guard until the hatchlings have had their second molting episode. The babies hatch from their eggs after two months. And the hatchlings are more or less the same in their physical attributes as that of an adult. The number of segments is the same throughout its whole life that can carry on for nearly a decade. However, it does go through the process of molting to shed its exoskeleton. After molting, they enter a new stage known as an instar. This process repeats a few times until they are old enough to mate. A Giant Desert Centipede measures up to 6.5 inches but it can cross 8 inches if it is out in the wild. It is the largest centipede in North America. Their head is flattened and round in shape and has a segmented body. Their head bears a pair of antennae that helps them navigate through their surroundings. This is because they do not have any eyes. Their head is sometimes orange in color along with the first part of their segmented body. That is why they are sometimes called “Giant Redheaded Centipede” or “Texas Redheaded Centipede” in various regions. But they exist in different colors. When it comes to their body, they have around 26 to 30 segments, each carrying a pair of legs. However, it is hard to determine which end is the mouth and which end is the tail, at times. Their legs are usually yellow and their bodies are often greenish black. They have a pair of elongated mandibles and two pairs of maxillae that can be used to pinch. Each centipede has around 20 pairs of legs and a set of hind legs at the back of its body. In total, they may have 21 to 23 pairs of legs. Their front limbs have injectors that carry venom inside that can help to bring the prey down. Their biggest survival instinct is their venomous legs. In addition, they display aposematism. This is a general phenomenon where an animal changes its color to warn the predator that they are poisonous. Since this centipede carries venom in its legs, it warns its predator by changing its color. This keeps both the prey and the predator safe from potential harm. They are nocturnal in nature. You can find them hiding during the day and coming out to hunt at night. In addition, although they are poisonous, they are only slightly aggressive. The Giant Desert Centipede is found only in two countries but its population is quite widespread. Some of the main regions where it is located are Arkansas , Southern Missouri , Louisiana , Kansas , Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , and Northern Mexico. They can take residence in any place where there is shelter. They stay hidden in the warmer seasons and are often seen out during cloudy weather. You can spot them in rocky woodlands, under rocks, potted plants , decayed wood spaces, and such. They tend to lay eggs under rocks or in concealed spaces so they usually stay hidden. Since they are nocturnal, you can only find them at night trying to hunt down their prey. The Giant Desert Centipede is slightly aggressive in nature. Although it is venomous, its venom is only used to subdue its prey. The venom is capable of paralyzing the nervous system of insects and making it difficult for them to escape. The same goes for smaller vertebrates. As for other vertebrates like humans , the venom has had different effects. A rat showed it was in incredible pain after the sting of the Giant Desert Centipede but went back to its normal state after a few hours. Similarly, when it attacked humans, the bite only caused swelling and sharp pain. This went away after a few hours and it has not produced any fatalities or deaths to date. Now, the venom of the Giant Desert Centipede has not been studied in detail much because it disintegrates quickly. But it has not shown to be much danger. Giant Desert Centipede are carnivorous in nature. They use venom to hunt down their prey but can also reach out in the air to feed on small insects. The centipedes are capable of eating small amphibians and vertebrates because of their larger size. A Giant Desert Centipede may eat small insects, toads , rodents , and small snakes , and may feed on moths if kept in captivity. Their predators include owls , coyotes , ringtails, bobcats , and badgers . The best advice for the Giant Desert Centipede would be to not bother them unless they bother you. This is because if they are provoked, they will be forced to bite you. But if you do come across one hiding out in your home, it is best to steer clear. A good rule of thumb is that it is best to set out precautionary measures. The pinch of the Giant Desert Centipede might not be fatal but it is extremely painful, nonetheless.

    "Name": "Sable German Shepherd",
    "Fun_Fact": "The gene responsible for their color is also found in wolves.",
    "Text": "The gene responsible for their color is also found in wolves. Sable German Shepherds are known as the classic German Shepherd, believed to closely resemble the original Shepherds. This eager-to-work herding dog boasts a beautiful sable double coat, which means that its hair strands contain multiple bands of colors like tan, red, silver, or brown and have black tips. The Sable German Shepherd is a rare variation of the more popular standard German Shepherd that is just black and tan in color. The original German Shepherds were believed to be sable-colored and this coloring changes constantly throughout the dog’s life. Despite their reputation as vicious dogs who bite at the slightest provocation, German Shepherds are one of the best dogs you could ask for. They are a highly intelligent breed, easy to train, fun-loving, and people-oriented. These sweet pups are guaranteed to put a smile on your face every day. Sable German Shepherds are identical in size and weight to other German Shepherds. They are medium-sized to large dogs. The males are 24 to 26 inches tall and 65-95 pounds, while the females grow up to 24 inches tall and weigh 50 to 70 pounds. Sable German Shepherds are generally healthy dogs. However, they are prone to some health conditions. One of the most common disorders that may plague these dogs is hip dysplasia. This is a hereditary condition that causes ball and socket joint malformation in the hip. This condition can be helped by making sure your fur baby works out properly to toughen up their legs. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Other conditions that can affect your pup are bloat, diabetes, bladder stones, cataract, and thyroid issues. It is imperative that you take your dog to the vet for checkups regularly to detect any signs of poor health before it escalates. Also, when purchasing a Sable German Shepherd puppy, be sure that the breeder is reputable and the health of the mother is guaranteed. In total, Sable German Shepherds commonly suffer from: Sable German Shepherds are even-tempered dogs. They are very energetic, playful, silly at times, but turn serious once they notice their owner is being serious. These dogs are people-oriented and love to follow their owners everywhere like a shadow. They tend to grow so attached to their families that they suffer from separation anxiety when left alone. Their temperament is a sharp contrast to their reputation as aggressive dogs. All dogs can become aggressive if they are frightened or harmed in any way. They are not more aggressive than other breeds. Sable German Shepherds are great with kids as well and can be very playful. However, the kids should be instructed on how to handle these big dogs, and the dogs should be well-trained on how to exercise restraint during play sessions. Raising any dog requires work and effort. The Sable German Shepherd is easily trained, groomed, and you get the reward of a devoted, heartwarming companion for the rest of its life. Sable German Shepherds should be grown on a diet that will support its active lifestyle. Since they are large dogs, they will need large food portions to sustain them. If you’re not sure how much to feed your dog, then you can check on the back of the food bag. It should contain instructions on how much to feed your dog by its weight. Because your furry friend is in danger of bloating, you should make sure not to let it exercise too close after mealtime. Your Sable German Shepherd needs food that is high in protein, moderate in carbs, and low in fat. We at A-Z Animals recommend the Royal Canin Breed Health Dry Dog Food . This food is made specially for German Shepherds with high quality ingredients that are guaranteed to boost its muscles and joints and give it the fuel it needs for physical activity. You can check for this product on Chewy or Amazon. Sable German Shepherds have double coats and shed a lot. However, frequent brushing helps keep their loose hairs manageable. These dogs have shedding seasons twice a year which means they shed even more profusely than any other period. Some Sable German Shepherds have medium-length coats and some have long coats, so if you are bent on getting this type of dog and suffer from allergies, then you can opt for one with a medium coat to minimize the amount of shedding and brushing you would have to do every week. Another thing you can do to reduce and control shedding is using anti-shedding products on your dog. The most ideal product for your Sable German Shepherd is the Shed X Shed Control Shampoo for Dogs. This shampoo is sulfate-free so you don’t have to worry about it drying out your dog’s skin or fur. It also contains moisturizing ingredients such as flaxseed oil and vitamins to boost the shine of your fur baby’s hair. Check Chewy or Amazon for this shampoo. Don’t forget to also trim your dog’s nails regularly to avoid injury to them. If you can hear the light tapping of your pup’s nails on the floor as it walks by, then it’s time for a trim. Usually, if your dog is active enough, their nails will wear down on their own. In addition to this, it is important to clean your dog’s ears and teeth to prevent infection. Due to their brilliance, Sable German Shepherds are easy to train. The best part is that they love it, too. They are working dogs, so they get excited when there is something new for them to do or learn. These dogs pick up cues quickly and with ease, which is why they are used in the police force, the military, and as therapy and disability aid dogs. If you love to exercise and go on fitness expeditions, then this is the right dog for you. Sable German Shepherds are agile dogs who love to exercise. They need about 60 to 90 minutes of exercise every day, which is pretty high. If you are the couch potato type, then you won’t have the time or energy to keep up with these active pups. They love to swim, jog, play, run, and hike. Not only is it good for their health, but it makes them happy and keeps them entertained. Sable German Shepherds puppies need socialization. These dogs were bred for protective roles and having their guard up is basically in their genes. They can be taught to be more open and tolerant of other people. They also have a very high prey drive so they need to grow up around other animals of all sizes to understand what is food and what isn’t. It is also vital to allow your pup to experience unfamiliar situations to get it accustomed to them. Allow them to be around strangers and strange places so they can explore for themselves. This will let them know that the unfamiliar doesn’t always spell danger."

    "Name": "Hooded Seal",
    "Features": "The male’s inflatable “hood” and red nose balloon.",
    "Fun_Fact": "Hooded seal pups are called bluebacks because the color of the fur on their back is blue-gray. This pretty color made people want to make fur coats out of them and made them a target for hunters.",
    "Text": "“The seal with the inflatable red nose.” A casual look at a male hooded seal reveals a typical large true seal . This means he has a blubbery, cylindrical body, no ear flaps, small flippers, and a tail that makes him an excellent swimmer but clumsy on the ice floes where he usually lives. But then, if the hooded seal is about to go for a dive or wants to impress a rival or a female, the skin on top of his head can balloon to the size of two footballs. Not only this, but he can shut off one of his nostrils and fill the other with so much air that another balloon, this one bright red, pops out of his nose. Both the balloon on the head and the one that comes out of the animal’s nose can produce sounds that warn rivals and would-be predators and attract females. Here are some facts about this unusual pinniped: This species’ scientific name is Cystophora cristata. Cystophora is Greek for “bladder-bearer,” and describes the bladder-like structure found on the male hooded seal’s head. Cristata is Latin for “crested.” There are only one species of hooded seals, though biologists separate them into two populations. There’s the population in the northeast Atlantic and a population in the northwest Atlantic. The hooded seal is a large seal with silver-gray fur with black spots. They have black faces and small limbs. Though their limbs are small, these seals are expert swimmers and divers. Males are a little longer than females but weigh much more. They can weigh 661 pounds on average to a female’s 353 pounds, and of course, they can inflate their nasal passages. Hooded seals also differ from other seals in the adaptations nature made to their teeth. Unlike other seals, they have two incisors in their upper jaw and one incisor in their lower jaw. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The male hooded seal’s “hood” and red nose have long been objects of fascination for biologists. They are the result of a cavity or bladder in the seal’s nose that can stretch. When it’s not inflated, the bladder hangs down over the seal’s mouth. When he inflates it, it makes his head look almost twice as big as it is, which intimidates opponents and is supposed to impress females. When the hood is partially inflated, the seal also blows up the stretchy septum in their left nasal cavity till it resembles a red balloon. When the seal shakes these balloons, they can make whooshing and pinging noises that are audible over land and in the water. Hooded seals are largely solitary until the breeding season, which is unusual. They don’t establish social hierarchies or fight over territories, though male seals will compete for an area around a female. Even after they give birth, hooded seal cows and their pups don’t stay together long. Seals mostly eat during the fall and winter and stop eating during the spring and summer when they breed and shed their old fur. This means that the mother doesn’t eat while they’re nursing their pups even as the pups gain 15 pounds every day on their very fatty milk until they’re weaned. She loses 15 to 22 pounds every day in the meantime. After the spring breeding season, the seals enter the water again to find food, then haul out in the summer to molt. Hooded seals spend most of their time swimming and diving in the cold waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. They haul out on ice floes or on land that is covered with ice and are careful to migrate to areas where ice floes are plentiful. The seal’s diet is mainly crustaceans and fish . They are partial to the capelin, which is a type of smelt found in cold northern waters. This small fish gives the seal the fat it stores in its blubber and utilizes when it doesn’t eat. Other foods are squid and octopus , cod , redfish, herring , and halibut. Humans have been the main predators of hooded seals. The animals have been hunted since at least the 18th century and were harvested so indiscriminately that it was difficult for their populations to recover. They were first killed for oil and to make leather out of their hides. Then, even baby seals were killed for their beautiful fur, and their mothers were often killed as they tried to protect them. Some people are subsistence hunters of hooded seals, but the seal has been so depleted by commercial hunting that even subsistence hunting is problematic. Seals are also found stranded on beaches and get entangled in nets meant for other marine animals. Less rapacious predators of the animal are killer whales , sharks , including the Greenland shark , and polar bears . Seals, which don’t move well out of the water, are especially vulnerable when they are breeding or molting on pack ice. Smaller predators include heartworms, which infest the animal’s heart and lung arteries and can shorten its life. These animals that are held in captivity also die from tuberculosis and infection. Hooded seals are eaten by killer whales, sharks, and polar bears. The hooded seal eats fish, marine mollusks, and marine crustaceans. Though the physical adaptations of the adults allow them to dive deeply to find this food, newly weaned pups have to catch their prey close to the shore. The breeding season for the hooded seal is in spring. Since she nurses her pup for such a short time, a hooded seal cow attracts the attention of males shortly after she gives birth. The males inflate and sound their balloons both to impress her and to threaten each other. Sometimes they will simply shove each other off the pack ice. The bull and cow mate in the water, then he’ll go off and find another cow. In the meantime, the first cow is pregnant for about eight months. The mother is fiercely protective of the baby for as long as it’s nursing. The hooded seal population is believed to be 650,000 animals according to the MarineBio Conservation Society . Still, the animal is listed as vulnerable . The northwest Atlantic population is either stable or increasing, but the northeast Atlantic population is still in decline. Though the hooded seal is still hunted in areas, it is protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and is subject to a strict quota. No more than 10,000 hooded seals can be caught in any given year around the world."

    "Name": "German Sheprador",
    "Fun_Fact": "There is a chance that the German Sheprador may inherit a love for water from its parent.",
    "Text": "The Labrador Retriever was originally bred to be an excellent swimmer. The German Sheprador may likewise inherit many traits that make it fast and agile in the water. The German Sheprador is an all-around excellent and obedient dog that nevertheless requires quite a lot of care and attention. It is the offspring of Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd parents. The German Shepherd is a large work or herding dog that originated from Germany around the turn of the 20th century. The Labrador Retriever was originally bred from the St. Johns Water Dog in its native Newfoundland around the early 19th century. Its primary purpose was to retrieve game for its owner. See all of our expert product reviews . While these two breeds will sometimes reproduce naturally on their own, it wasn’t until the 1990s that people began to breed them deliberately together on a regular basis. The term for a cross between two purebred dogs is a “designer dog.” While there is no agreed-upon Sheprador standard, it is usually a large dog with a long, square muzzle and somewhat downturned ears. The straight and dense medium to long coat of fur will have a combination of black, white, cream, blue, grey, and red colors and markings. It bears many hallmarks of an ideal companion. The German Sheprador is a medium or large dog with a muscular frame. Males are slightly larger than females on average. The German Sheprador is a healthy dog with a lifespan of around 10 to 14 years if it can avoid any serious complications. Nevertheless, this dog may be prone to some of the same conditions as its parents, including ear infections, allergies, cancer, weight gain, hip dysplasia (which causes the hip joint to come out of alignment), and bloating (a serious condition which causes the stomach to expand to a dangerous size). Some of these issues could be avoided by seeking out a high-quality breeder who screens for genetic conditions. To sum up some of the most common health problems: The German Sheprador has a protective, alert, and fiercely loyal personality; in other words, many of the traits that make for a good watchdog. When it hears a stranger approaching at the door, it will immediately alert its owner by barking. But this hybrid dog is also very friendly, affectionate, and intelligent, which make it suitable as a family-friendly companion. The German Sheprador needs frequent mental and physical stimulation, or else it may become bored and start engaging in destructive behavior. It does not do as well in smaller physical spaces. This makes it better suited for large houses than apartment living. Since the German Sheprador has a tendency to chew, it is always a good idea to have a steady supply of toys around to give it something to do. Keep in mind that every dog is its own individual and might not conform to the standard behavioral template in every single way. See all of our expert product reviews . The German Sheprador is a difficult dog to care for, so it is recommended for experienced owners who have the time and ability to take care of its needs. Starting as a puppy, the German Sheprador should have a regular physical examination at the vet to catch early health problems. If you need any help with the dog’s daily routine and care, then you should consult with your vet as well. Depending on its size, age, and energy level, this large, active dog needs up to 3 cups of high-quality food, preferably divided into multiple meals per day to prevent some bloating. The German Sheprador does have some tendency to gain weight, so you should not leave food out for it to munch on. If it appears to be putting on weight, then you should restrict its calorie intake. They also sometimes have allergic reactions to certain foods like chicken or beef. If this is the case, then the solution is to buy dog food specifically designed for allergy sufferers. A-Z Animals believes Farmina Natural & Delicious Ocean Ancestral Grain Cod & Orange Adult Medium & Maxi Dog Food is the best dog food for German Shepradors. Not only does this unique formula use fish like cod and herring as alternative protein to help out with allergic reactions, but the protein is adequately balanced with healthy carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. The real animal protein is a natural source of glucosamine to help prevent hip dysplasia, while omegas and turmeric safeguard the immune system. It’ll satisfy your German Sheprador’s appetite for a healthy weight. Check Chewy or Amazon for this product. Despite its tendency to shed, the German Sheprador only needs to be brushed a few times per week, preferably with a pin brush, comb, and deshedder. This should be combined with daily teeth brushings and frequent dental chews to keep the dog’s oral health in excellent order. You should also check the dog’s ears every day and clean them as necessary to prevent the buildup of debris and obstructions. Finally, the occasional bath once every two months should be sufficient to maintain a healthy coat. Use a gentle shampoo to prevent skin irritation and damage to the coat. This dog needs to be socialized from an early age and taught how to interact with other dogs, children, and strangers. Fortunately, the Sheprador should be very easy to train. It responds well to human commands and learns quickly. If you plan to use the crate often to transport your dog , then crate and kennel training should probably be a part of its routine as a puppy as well. If you need help with any aspect of its training, then you should try to find a professional in your area. The German Sheprador is a very high-energy dog that will need at least an hour of exercise every single day. It is recommended that you have a large yard, dog park, or other wide open space nearby in which it can run around, play, and burn off excess energy. This dog will also enjoy long walk or jog with its owner. Swimming is another great option if you have a pool or lake around your home. When you’ve finally decided that you want to bring home a German Sheprador, the most important step is to find an appropriate breeder. It’s worth the extra effort to do your homework and find a high-quality breeder in your area that tends to breed healthy puppies from the best stock. As an alternative to a breeder, you might also want to consider trying to find a rescue group that carries this mix. After bringing it home, the German Sheprador may take up to two years to properly grow and develop. In that time, it is a good idea to not let your dog to run or play on hard surfaces, at least until its joints are fully developed. The German Sheprador is a good family pet and should get along very well with children; though this dog will behave best if it’s been trained and socialized from an early age. Its large size and high energy could be intimidating to smaller children, so you should not leave them alone together in the same room without an adult present. The German Sheprador bears many strong similarities with other retriever and work dogs, whether purebreds or hybrids. Apart from its two parent breeds, the Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd, it is the most similar to the following types of dogs: The German Sheprador is probably too niche and new to enjoy much of a following, but its two parent breeds are incredibly popular in the United States. Perhaps the most famous dog of all time, the TV and movie star Rin Tin Tin (along with his various descendants who also bear the name), was a German Shepherd.

    "Name": "Spongy Moth 2",
    "Fun_Fact": "In March of 2022, the Entomological Society of America changed the name of this insect from the European gypsy moth to the spongy moth out of respect for the Romani community, which considers the word gypsy to be offensive.",
    "Text": "The spongy moth, formerly known as the European gypsy moth, is a species of insect native to Europe and Africa , which has become a troublesome invasive species in North America . Its scientific name is Lymantria dispar dispar, a member of the family Erebidae. Larvae from the spongy moth consume the foliage of over 500 species of plants, including shrubs and hardwood trees. Once known as the gypsy moth, the Lymantria dispar has been renamed “spongy moth” to avoid offending the Romani people. This species has three subspecies, though there is some discussion as to whether or not they are genuinely distinct from one another. The subspecies known as the European gypsy moth is now known simply as the spongy moth, the representative of the overarching species, and goes by the name Lymantria dispar dispar. The history of Lymantria dispar goes back to Carl Linnaeus , the Swedish botanist known as the creator of modern taxonomy. He was the first to describe the species in 1758. There has been some controversy over classification over the years, as families and superfamilies have bounced between Lymantriinae, Erebidae, and Noctuidae. In addition to Lymantria dispar dispar , the species includes the subspecies Lymantria dispar asiatica and Lymantria dispar japonica . The spongy moth’s binomial designation uses two Latin words; Lymantria is based on the word for “destroyer.” Dispar refers to a word meaning “unequal,” referring to the different characteristics between the male and female spongy moths. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Spongy moths can be identified at many stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The clusters of eggs that the female lays are oval and measure 3/4 inch by 1 and 1/2 inches. They are the same color as manila folders, though they may pale in color during winter. They are covered by hair-like bristles, which give them a sponge-like appearance, inspiring their name. At the larval stage, they are about 1/8 of an inch long when they first hatch and will grow to lengths of about 2 to 3 and 1/2 inches. When they first hatch they are black with what are called “setae,” which are hair-like bristles. As they age, their backs develop a series of blue spots (five pairs) and red spots (six pairs) with a few setae. Before the pupal stage begins, larvae stop eating and create a silk cover. Spongy moth pupae are sometimes covered in a thin cocoon, but sometimes they’ll hang directly from branches or bark. The pupa itself is dark, with sparse setae emerging from the shell. There are some differences between males and females. Females have light antennae, while those of the males are like tiny feathers. Females are also larger than males. The forewings of the males are just under an inch long, while those of the females measure up to 1 and 3/8 inches, though they cannot fly. Although the spongy moth was originally native to Europe, being found throughout the continent to the Ural Mountains of Russia , down to the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and North Africa, it was introduced to North America over 150 years ago. Since then, it has taken up residence in hardwood forests of the Eastern U.S. and Canada , feasting on more than 500 species of shrubs and trees. After mating, females will lay fuzzy clusters of about 500 eggs on just about anything upright, including shrubs, trees, cars, and rocks. The fuzz on these clusters can cause rashes, like the hairs, on the larvae. After hatching, the larvae will sail on silken strands to trees to feed on. At first, feeding will occur during the daytime on the hairs of the leaf and then on the epidermis. As they age, they will begin to feed at night, hiding away under leaves, bark, branches, or other protection. If there are not many moths in the area, larvae will pupate in the sheltered areas of their night feeding. If numbers are high, they will pupate anywhere, even open locations. After emerging from their cocoons, moths will mostly limit their activity to night, as they are nocturnal. Males can be found flying up and down objects searching for females. The spongy moth belongs to the order Lepidoptera, which is the same order that includes butterflies . Lepidoptera have co-evolved with plants and predators over millions of years, taking their place between the plants which create their food with photosynthesis and predators which cannot. The spongy moth was native to Europe until it was introduced in 1868 to the United States by Etienne Trouvelot, a French scientist trying to create a hybrid species of silk-spinning caterpillar. Some moths in captivity escaped and began their slow progression through the Eastern regions of the United States and Canada. It is now devastating trees within that region. Within 20 years, infestations began occurring in New England. By 1923, a barrier zone was attempted from Canada to New York , but by 1939, the infestation spread beyond the barrier. The spongy moth had spread through the Northeastern U.S. to Ontario and Quebec. It has now spread through the Virginias to Illinois , Michigan , Minnesota , and Wisconsin . There have been some outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest, but steps have been taken to eliminate them. The female spongy moth is unable to fly. This has slowed its spread in the Eastern U.S. and Canada over the last 150 years. With limited flight as a species, the spongy moth can travel via two methods. Over short distances, recently hatched larvae can float on air currents on short strands of spun silk, the way some spiders travel. The majority of travel, however, is due to human migration. Moths attach themselves to vehicles, firewood, and outdoor furniture. Approximately 85 percent of new outbreaks have resulted from this kind of movement. The spongy moth plays a pivotal ecological role, bridging plants that convert energy to food through photosynthesis and predators that rely on animals that take in that energy. Some predators or threats are better than others at controlling the spongy moth population. Rodents like the common white-footed mouse will eat larval or pupal moths sheltering near the ground. Another mammal that consumes spongy moth larvae and pupae is the northern short-tailed shrew . A variety of birds eat the larva of the spongy moth, including the blue jay , the northern oriole , the European robin , and the black-capped chickadee , but their impact on the moth population is not well known. The forest caterpillar hunter is a beetle that eats the larvae and pupae of the spongy moth and has an impact on limited populations. Several parasitic flies and wasps can attack and inhabit the eggs before the larval stage, as well as a few that can affect the larvae and pupae, but their impact is limited. In addition to the predators and parasites above, viruses, bacteria, and fungi can kill the spongy moth. The Japanese fungus, Entomophaga maimaiga , has been shown to impact the population of the spongy moth. It was tried as early as 1910 in North America but wasn’t used effectively until the 1980s. Spongy moth larvae will feed on many hardwood and conifer trees and shrubs but prefer oak trees . Aspen, apple, birch, poplar, and willow in the Eastern U.S. are also favorites. There are a few trees that the spongy moth will avoid, including sycamore, black walnut, butternut, flowering dogwood, and cedar, among others. However, they may feed on these during later development stages when food is scarce due to overpopulation. Also, older larvae may feed on softwoods, which younger ones usually avoid. The spongy moth is responsible for extensive defoliation in the Eastern U.S. In the 40 years after 1970, the spongy moth destroyed over 80 million acres and cost the economy millions of dollars. Nearly 13 million acres were lost in 1981 alone. In attempts to control the spongy moth, parasitic and predatory flies and wasps were introduced with mixed success starting in the late 1800s. Some of these species attacked and decimated native species, causing more environmental harm than help. The best agents introduced were viruses and fungi, the most effective of which was Entomophaga maimaiga , a Japanese fungus. Other ways of controlling the spongy moth include:"

    "Name": "Tawny Frogmouth",
    "Features": "Streaky gray feathers, excellent for camouflage",
    "Fun_Fact": "The tawny frogmouth is a master of camouflage that can hide in plain sight!",
    "Text": "The tawny frogmouth is a master of camouflage that can hide in plain sight! What superpower would you choose, silent flight or invisibility? Night vision or super hearing? The tawny frogmouth says, “All of the above, please!” This master of camouflage hides in plain sight during the day and hunts at night, gobbling up creatures that its human neighbors consider to be pests. It doesn’t fly around searching for a meal. Instead, it conserves energy, sitting and waiting on a branch until an unsuspecting morsel gets close. Then it pounces and grabs its prey in its powerful beak, or makes a quick and silent flight, catching it in midair. This stealthy bird might look like an owl, or a dead branch, but it is neither. It is, however, the “most instagrammable bird” in the world. Tawny frogmouths are found throughout most of Australia, including the island state of Tasmania. They live in just about every sort of habitat except for dry and treeless desert regions and dense rainforests. Scientists believe that Australian frogmouths diverged from other known genera at least 30 million years ago , meaning the modern frogmouth species have a long history on the continent. The tawny frogmouth lives in woodlands, primarily eucalyptus and acacia, in scrublands, heathlands, and savannas. It also lives in parks, gardens and other urban areas including backyards. It spends most of its time in trees, particularly mature trees with dead or rough branches. People are more likely to hear tawny frogmouths than see them. They call loudly at night with a low and almost continuous, “oom-oom-oom.” However, you could be very close to one of these stealthy birds in broad daylight and never see it. They are so cleverly camouflaged and able to sit so very still, they practically disappear. One look at the tawny frogmouth will tell you where it got part of its name. The wide, frog-like mouth is common to this and other frogmouth species. The scientific name of this bird is Podargus strigoides. Strigoides is derived from the Latin word for owl. That makes sense because this bird looks a lot like an owl. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Podargus, the name of the bird’s genus, means “gouty.” The frogmouths in this genus were so named because of their feet, which are much more adapted to sitting than walking. They walk with a painful-looking gait like someone suffering from a case of gout. That’s okay, though, because they don’t spend much time on the ground. There are three subspecies of tawny frogmouths. The subspecies P. s. phalaenoides lives primarily in northern Australia , P. s. brachypterus lives west of the Great Dividing Ridge, and P. s. strigoides lives east of the Great Dividing Ridge and in Tasmania. Sometimes the tawny frogmouth is mistakenly called a “mopoke,” the nickname for the Southern Boobook owl. Although they share some similarities, the frogmouth is not an owl. These birds vary in size and appearance based on the subspecies. The P.s. strigoides subspecies is the largest of the three. They can be anywhere between 13 and 21 inches in length and range from a little over 6 ounces to approximately 24 ounces in weight. Their wingspan averages between 2 and 3 feet. The feathers of these birds are mostly gray, with white streaks and light barring. Some females are a bit more chestnut or rufous colored. The best way to describe their coloration would be the appearance of old tree bark, because tawny frogmouths can blend in almost seamlessly with the limbs of mature trees. The birds have big, yellow eyes and wide curved beaks. The insides of their mouths are bright yellow, or yellow-green, and they present a gaping mouth display to frighten or distract other birds or predators. Their legs are short, and their feet are weak, especially as compared to the powerful talons of owls. These birds do resemble owls closely enough that many people get confused, but it bears repeating, they are not owls. They are members of the nightjar family and are closely related to nighthawks and whip-poor-wills. This bird is mainly nocturnal or crepuscular, meaning it is most active at night or in the twilight hours of dusk and dawn. It hunts at night using a sneaky sit and wait approach, waiting and watching for prey to come near, then pouncing down upon it or chasing it through the air. During the day, it spends much of its time sleeping, but usually with one or both eyes slightly open to watch out for predators. When it is awake during the day, the bird spends time with its mate, grooming each other, taking turns guarding their territory, or working together to raise their chicks. This silent sitting approach works well for the tawny frogmouth, thanks to its amazing camouflage. If the bird senses a threat, it takes stealth to another level. It stretches its body out, tightens its feathers and holds a pose, completely still, so that it looks just like a dead branch. Predators are often fooled, as evidenced by the bird’s long lifespan in the wild. In the winter, tawny frogmouths use a few techniques to survive the cold. They huddle together to conserve heat. They also position themselves on branches in direct sunlight to absorb as much heat as possible. On especially cold nights, when food is scarce, they enter a state of torpor for a period of a few hours between dusk and dawn. During torpor, they reduce their metabolism and temperature significantly to reduce their energy consumption before arising to hunt again, usually close to daybreak. The tawny frogmouth hunts mainly at night and in the twilight hours. Although people often mistake this nocturnal bird for an owl, its hunting style differs significantly. Instead of flying through the air and snatching prey with its feet, the tawny frogmouth uses its large beak exclusively for catching food. Sometimes it flies and catches nocturnal insects like moths in midair. Other times it sits and waits patiently in a tree until an unsuspecting creature comes close, and then it pounces down and grabs it with its beak. Humans appreciate this bird for eating large quantities of prey that are considered pests, especially the swarming Christmas beetles that strip eucalyptus trees. They eat all sorts of insects , including moths , cockroaches and beetles . They also devour spiders , centipedes , millipedes , scorpions , slugs , snails and other invertebrates. Tawny frogmouths are also known to eat small rodents , lizards , frogs and even other birds . These birds form monogamous pairs that live together for many years. When they are not hunting, they spend most of their time together, leaning against each other, roosting side by side and grooming one another. They stay together in the same territory for years. Both the males and females work together to build a nest of twigs and leaves about 3 to 10 meters above the ground. It is not a sturdy nest, but more of a loose pile of material in the fork of a tree. The nests often fall apart, and younger chicks in a brood are prone to falling to the ground. Pairs usually have only one brood per year, with one to three eggs. Breeding takes place in the Australian spring, usually from August through October. Both the male and female incubate the eggs, with the male sitting on the nest during the day. Incubation lasts about a month. Juveniles are lighter colored than their parents and easier to see, so the parents hide them underneath their own bodies to protect them from predators. Nest predation is still a constant threat, and although both parents feed and guard their young, nestling mortality is high. Fledglings leave the nest after about 27 to 32 days, but they stay close to their parents for some time before dispersing, usually during their first summer. They reach sexual maturity at about 12 months of age and begin the search for a mate of their own. Tawny frogmouths are susceptible to predators as adults and in the nest. The most dangerous time for an adult is when it flies to the ground to catch prey. Domestic cats are the bird’s primary predator, but dogs , foxes , falcons and pythons are also deadly foes. Pythons and other snakes also prey on juveniles and eggs in the nest. So do ravens , currawongs, and butcherbirds. The lace monitor lizard , a fearsome reptile more than six feet long, is also known to climb trees and attack tawny frogmouth nests. The tawny frogmouth’s main defense against predators is camouflage. If they can avoid detection by staying very still, or by hiding their nestlings under their own bodies, they will. Otherwise, they will use defensive displays, such as opening their mouths wide to flash the bright yellow insides, erecting spiky-looking feathers around their heads, and clacking loudly. They are also not above spraying foul-smelling feces to confuse reptilian predators. This bird lives as long as 14 years in the wild, and some individuals have survived more than 30 years in captivity. Although its population is undetermined, it is considered stable and the species is listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List. Besides predators, three factors are considered the greatest threats to tawny frogmouths. Pesticides are a particular danger, especially those used on rodents, because the poisons consumed by prey end up ingested by the predator, too. Fires are another threat affecting this bird, mainly because it is so staunchly territorial. Individuals stick to the same territory for many years, and they have a hard time picking up and relocating even when disaster strikes. Finally, cars are perhaps the greatest threat to the tawny frogmouth. When the urban dwelling birds hunt at night, chasing a moth or other prey, they often fly low across roads. Car strikes are common and end the lives of many birds. A 2021 research study on bird photography and social media found that the tawny frogmouth is the world’s “ most instagrammable bird .” This study referenced 20,000 photos of birds on the Instagram platform and compared their numbers of likes relative to their level of exposure. Just a few years earlier it had been dubbed “the world’s most unfortunate-looking bird.” Some people think the bird is irresistibly adorable, while others think it is just plain ugly. But love it or hate it, the tawny frogmouth is definitely something to see."

    "Name": "Peppered Moth",
    "Features": "Black (peppered) spots",
    "Fun_Fact": "Teachers in schools often use the evolution of the peppered moth as a good example of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.",
    "Text": "Teachers in schools often use the evolution of the peppered moth as a good example of Darwin’s theory of natural selection. The Peppered Moth is a small insect of merely a few inches that has tiny black spots on its wings. Hence, the name Peppered Moth. It exists as the best example of evolution in the history of science. Researchers discovered a special gene whose presence in this moth turned its whole color black. This allowed them to study natural selection and helped in understanding evolution. The peppered moth Biston betularia is a species of European moth in the family Geometridae and of the order, Lepidoptera. There are only one known species Biston betularia of the Peppered Moth, however, there are a few subspecies. The Peppered Moth may be found in three different colors, pale grey, dark black color, and black with white spots coloration. This ultimately helped in learning about natural selection. But an unfortunate thing about their species is that they became very sparse in number during the 1980s but soon after, they began to repopulate. While there are a lot of moths in the world , more than 160,000, the exact number of the Peppered Moth population is not known yet. They are, however, found in various parts of Europe . The seven subspecies of the Peppered Moth, as described by scientists, are as follows; See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The Peppered Moth is best identified because of the markings on its body. This helps them camouflage with their surroundings and protects them from unwanted dangers. Their habitat usually consists of tree bark which makes their camouflage perfect for protection. It has a broad, long, and slender body that resembles a twig-like caterpillar . It is covered in fur and has long wings as narrow and straight that it prefers keeping on the outside. The wings also have brown bands on the frame and carry a wingspan of 1.5 – 2.5 inches. The color is usually white with black pepper-like spots but some of them have a completely black body. If you take a deep look at their heads, you will find a small cleft that makes it appear as a broken stem, again which is great for camouflage. In addition, their legs resemble that of long thorns that not only help in locomotion but also hide them completely in the tree bark. All in all, the Peppered Moth is the perfect agent in camouflage. The Peppered Moth has a very distinctive look, and also shows similarities to a lichen. A lichen is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae that has a disoriented type structure found on many trees and plants . This unique characteristic makes the peppered moth look even more like a tree branch. The Peppered Moth experience sexual dimorphism. The males have two, thick antennae with a feathery nature and are clearly distinguishable from the females. They are not found in groups. The Peppered Moth is solitary and can be found alone on top of tree bark. It makes sense for it to be unsociable as its whole life is part of a disguise in camouflage. However, they may sometimes be found in pairs in the form of a female and male Peppered Moth. The male keeps close to the female to mark its paternity. As for its behavior, the Peppered Moth comes out at night and does most of its flying in the nighttime as well. It is safe to say that it is a nocturnal insect , hiding from its predators in the morning under disguise, and in locomotion at night. They are found in various parts of the world but reside mainly in different parts of Europe . You can spot them in England, Ireland, Scotland, and the Northern parts of America. They are mainly found in shrublands and parklands. But some of their species can also be found in woodland forests. In these areas, their main site is the tree barks. Since they resemble a tree branch, they can easily disguise themselves as one of these tree barks. The Peppered Moths are usually seen flying around at night but during the seasons of May and August, they are seen together in pairs to mate and reproduce. The female can lay up to 2000 eggs in one reproductive cycle and these eggs can hatch into caterpillars within just two weeks. It all started in the 1800s when the population of the famous white-colored peppered moth suddenly started decreasing. In 1811, there was a black peppered moth with no spots discovered. In 1848, the population of this black type of the moth suddenly started surging at a high rate. The number of these species increased so much that by 1895, there was a record hit by the black peppered moths that outnumbered the light-colored ones by 98%. Later, it was realized that the sudden increase did not happen overnight but was a case of evolution. In those times in England, there was quite a high rate of air pollution. This caused drastic changes in the evolutionary processes of the peppered moth, supporting Darwin’s theory of evolution. Although Darwin had died 14 years before this happened, this example was presented in support of his theory. The assumption made during those times is one that the white-colored moths would sit on top of the tree bark like they do in disguise. But because of the black soot in the atmosphere and the rising industrial pollution, the lightish peppered moths became a victim of genetic mutation. In the later years, there was a decrease in the black peppered moths also known as melanic due to the genetic mutation. Again, this decrease was not unexpected. The black peppered moth is very vulnerable to its predators. It does not offer good camouflage and may be easily visible to the birds since it does not resemble any lichen. Hence, its breed eventually got eaten up by its predators, and there exist very few of them today. After proving the point of evolution, the peppered moth also supports the theory of natural selection. The black types were seen as larger in number in urban areas and cities. Since the tree barks were also affected by the air pollution, they also became black, offering the perfect disguise for the black peppered moths. Similarly, areas where the industries were not larger in number, witnessed a higher rate of the population of the paler peppered moths. This is because the environment in these areas suited the whitish peppered moths more. All in all, natural selection worked both ways. Hence proving that nature favored the best competitor respective of the environmental conditions. The Peppered Moths are mainly herbivores. The caterpillars can be seen munching on tree bark and shrubs. In contrast, the grown moths can eat fruit pulp, leaves, flower nectar, and sometimes even plant seeds. Its predators are mainly flycatchers, nuthatches, and the European robin . The Peppered Moths protect themselves by hiding in the sunlight and traveling by night. They disguise themselves on the tree bark, remaining in one position to avoid their predators. Take a look at a few of our other articles on moths!"

    "Name": "Arctic Fox",
    "Text": "Arctic foxes (often misspelled as artic fox or artic foxes) are small, adorable animals and have natural adaptations protecting them from predators and frigid temperatures. According to fossils, Arctic foxes got their start in Tibet during the Pliocene Epoch, 2.6 million years ago, then spread to North America and Eurasia by migrating over ice-land bridges. The species is Iceland’s only native mammal, and while hundreds of thousands currently roam around the Arctic Circle, climate change threatens to decimate populations in the coming years. Want to discover more facts? Make sure to read ‘ 10 Incredible Arctic Fox Facts ‘ to learn more about these amazing animals. The scientific name for these foxes is Vulpes lagopus — which has Ancient Greek and Latin roots. “Vulpes” is the Latin word for “ fox ,” and lagopus comes from two Ancient Greek words, lagōs, which means “hare,” and pous, which means “foot.” Together the scientific name translates to “hairy-footed fox.” In 1758, the father of taxonomy , Carl Linneaus, assigned the species two names: Alopex lagopus and Canis lagopus. Since then, scientists have gathered more genetic information and changed it to Vulpes lagopus. Arctic foxes are also known as white foxes, polar foxes, and snow foxes. Adult males are called “dogs” and females “vixens.” A group of these foxes is known as either a “skulk” or a “leash.” See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Tiriganiarjuk is the Inuit word for Arctic fox, which translates to “the little white one.” In other native languages, the species name translates to “the one who walks a lot.” The male foxes are slightly larger than females of the species. Large individuals are about the size of Jack Russell terriers ; smaller ones are the size of chihuahuas . Arctic foxes are animals that are present in two color morphs: white and blue. Ninety-nine percent have the white color morph, meaning their fur is white in winter to blend in with the ice and brown in summer to camouflage with cliffs and rocks. The other one percent — mainly in coastal regions — has the blue morph, meaning they have rock blue-ice coloring in the winter and gray-blue in the summer. These color adaptations help them blend into the environment and evade predators. Both male and female fox tails — aka “brushes” — measure about 12 inches (30 centimeters). More than just a balance aid, they also serve as blankets. It’s one of several adaptations that allow them to survive sub-zero winters. In addition to their long and warm tails, Arctic foxes also have fur-covered paws that work to keep their bodies toasty warm in the winter. Thick ears, short muzzles, and multilayer pelage also help Arctic foxes survive freezing environments . Their fur is the warmest of any mammal, and their compact bodies optimally conserve heat. Better yet, they can separately control their paw and core temperatures — which makes for comfortable ice walks! Ideally engineered to withstand harsh climates, they don’t start shivering until the mercury reaches -94 °F (-70 °C). Learn about the toughest animals in the world here . Arctic foxes are animals that can be active around the clock. During the autumn and winter, they lead more solitary lives and reduce activity to preserve insular fat — but they don’t hibernate. In the spring and summer, these foxes convene to live as families, breed, and raise pups. When not out hunting, foraging, or teaching pups survival tactics, arctic foxes hang out in gigantic, maze-like dens that typically face southward to best harness the sun’s heat. In warm weather, they sleep outside; during the harsh winters, they slumber inside. Arctic fox dens are constructed for maximum predator evasion and pup protection. Some are so complex that they have more than 100 entrances! Appreciative of their ancestors’ burrowing efforts, the foxes preserve dens instead of building new complexes every year. In fact, some are hundreds of years old! Where can you find Arctic foxes? The species populates the Northern Hemisphere’s Arctic Circle where summer temperatures range between 14 and 86 °F (-10 and 30 °C), and the winter thermometer hovers around -30° F (-34°C). Communities are scattered throughout the treeless tundra regions of North America, Asia, Europe, Greenland, and Iceland, with most populations living in pack-ice areas. However, some Canadian Arctic foxes inhabit boreal forests filled with pines and spruces. To date, scientists have identified four subspecies. The arctic fox was thought to originally evolve in Europe however, the ice sheets expanded during a glacial period that happened on Earth about 2.6 million years ago. With that said, fossil evidence now suggests that the animal may have pre-adapted to live in a harsh, freezing environment. That is one reason the mammal was able to survive. A jawbone was discovered while hiking up and down Tibetan mountains about 4,730 meters above sea level. That was the first discovery fossil that was unearthed that did not match any known fox species. Not only did the bone prove that arctic foxes existed in the area around that time, but also proved that they were mostly meat eaters. What do Arctic foxes eat? Their meals of choice are lemmings , voles, hares , and other small rodents. When their preferred meat is unavailable, Arctic foxes chow down on fish , snow geese eggs, ptarmigan, grouse , puffins , ringed seal pups, and reindeer . When things are truly scarce, they turn to berries and seaweed. And yes, when faced with starvation, they eat their own feces! During the summer and autumn, aided by their sharp smell and sight senses, they hunt prey. They can sniff out seal lairs from over a mile away and hear lemmings burrowing several inches below ground. On a good day, a family of foxes can down dozens of rodents. When lucky enough to have a surplus of food, the foxes bury it for a rainy day. But life gets a lot tougher in the winter. Meat is much harder to find, and vegetation is dormant. To survive, these foxes stalk polar bears and dine on their scraps. But it’s a dangerous endeavor because polar bears prey on foxes! What animals prey on Arctic foxes? The species’ main predators are polar bears , wolves , wolverines, brown bears , red foxes , and humans . They also must keep an eye out for fast golden eagles , bald eagles , and snowy owls that swoop down and snatch baby foxes. But these days, natural predators aren’t their worst threat — climate change and offshore drilling are fast becoming the species’ main nemesis. Arctic temperatures are skyrocketing — which leads to reduced sea ice and rising sea levels. Add some destructive oil extraction off the coast, and it’s an ecological tinderbox on the brink of explosion. Plus, even though the foxes are still plentiful in most regions, other animals are dying off and creating food shortages. Moreover, due to rapidly melting ice, their lighter coats are becoming a liability, not an advantage. To complete the perfect storm, increasingly, these foxes are losing ground to the larger red fox . Native Arctic peoples still retain the right to hunt polar foxes for sustenance, but commercial hunting of the species is now off-limits. When the snow melts and the sun comes out of hibernation, these foxes gather for the mating season between late February and May. In food-insecure populations, these foxes form monogamous pairs for the season. In communities where food is abundant, they’re more promiscuous and form complex social structures where multiple individuals look after each others’ newborns. Typically, inland populations are more monogamous than coastal ones — the exception is Icelandic Arctic foxes. The subspecies exhibit strong familial ties, and offspring will often stick around their parents’ territories for a long time, even in times of famine when food can be found elsewhere. Females gestate for about 52 days and give birth between April and July to litters ranging between five and 25, the most of all carnivore species. Baby Arctic foxes are called “kits.” They’re born with dark fur and enjoy the care and attention of both parents. Kits nurse for about 45 days and begin to emerge from the den after three weeks. By week nine, the pups are usually ready to make it independently. At nine months, they’re sexually mature and ready to start mating. Arctic foxes don’t live long. Though fast, in the wild most become bear prey between three and six years old. But even in captivity, they usually only make it to ten or eleven. Currently, several hundred thousand of these foxes live in the wild, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature categorizes the species under Least Concern on its Red List . But that doesn’t tell the whole story. Climate change is rapidly damaging Arctic fox habitats, and if things don’t change over the next decade, the species could become a global warming casualty. Already, the Scandinavian population is Endangered . Less than 200 individuals remain, and severe inbreeding further threatens its survival. Conservationists are in the process of introducing new individuals of breeding age into the area, but will their efforts work? It remains to be seen. Below is a partial list of U.S. zoos with these foxes. Detroit Zoo : Moxie and Alex, two females, live in the Detroit Zoo’s state-of-the-art Arctic Ring of Life habitat. San Diego Zoo : Despite being in sunny California, the San Diego Zoo is home to two of these foxes named Isiq and Kaniq that live in the Polar Bear Plunge enclosure. Stone Zoo : Stone Zoo, in Stoneham, Massachusetts, cares for two fast Arctic foxes that love to whiz around their enclosure. Point Defiance Zoo : Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington maintains a large exhibit for two of them. North Carolina Zoo : The Rocky Coast exhibit at the North Carolina Zoo is home to two of the foxes. Other stateside zoos with these foxes include:"

    "Name": "Orchid Dottyback",
    "Features": "bright purple color and black stripe from the head to the eye",
    "Fun_Fact": "This fish camouflages as its prey's parents to trick it into becoming dinner.",
    "Text": "This fish camouflages as its prey’s parents to trick it into becoming dinner. Orchid dottybacks are very popular aquarium pets because of the splash of color and activity they add to the environment. However, these bright purple fish are also crafty predators. They camouflage themselves in order to capture prey and manage to still look cute while doing it. The orchid dottyback belongs to the genus Pseudochromis and is classified as Pseudochromis fridmani . It is also a member of the famed dottyback family, Pseudochromidae . The generic name Pseudochromis is derived from two Greek words, pseudes meaning “false” and chromo meaning “color.” This is a nod to the abilities of the dottyback fish to mimic the appearance of its prey in order to increase the success of catching it. The specific name fridmani is to honor David Fridman, the man who collected the specimen in Israel. These fish are called dottybacks because of the colorful spots and patterns on their bodies. The orchid dottyback is also called Fridman’s dottyback or Fridman’s pseudochromis. Orchid dottybacks belong to the class of ray-finned fishes, Actinopterygii, which comprises over 50% of all vertebrate species alive. The earliest fossil record of an actinopterygian species was found to date back to the Late Silurian Period over 420 million years ago and belongs to Andreolepis hedei. Its remains have been discovered in Sweden, Estonia , and Russia . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The dottyback order, Pseudochromidae, are distinguishable from other fish families by the spines in their dorsal fins which number three or less, and also by their partial lateral line organ. Dottybacks also possess special cells which enable them to camouflage themselves by changing their coloration. These cells are known as chromatophores and they contain pigment sacs. When the fish pulls on these sacs with the use of small radial muscles, they can expand and contract the pigment, thereby changing its color. They use this feature of theirs to hide from predators, and also to entrap other fish as prey by pretending to be one of them. The orchid dottyback is a beautiful vivid purple, saltwater fish. It is often mistaken for the purple dottyback fish ( Pseudochromis porphyreus ) which is also a bright purple color. However, the orchid dottyback can be identified by the black stripe that runs across its head and over its eyes. The orchid dottyback is a tiny fish, measuring from 2.7 to 3 inches long. The coolest thing about orchid dottybacks is that they have the power of mimicry. Just like other members of Pseudochromidae , the orchid can change its color due to the chromatophores it possesses. Chromatophores are skin cells that contain pigment and reflect light. This gives the fish the ability to steadily modify their coloration. Orchid dottybacks have no sexual dimorphism. They all look the same, especially at a young age. When they are mature, the females do tend to have bigger bellies and can be a bit stocky as opposed to the slenderer bodies of the males. The orchid dottyback is a small, unassuming fish, but beneath their flashy exterior exists a cunning master of diguise. Dottybacks are one of many species of the dottyback family Pseudochromidae that are known to mimic the appearance of their prey. Orchid dottybacks possess chromatophores, or pigmented cells on their scaly bodies that reflect light and allow them to manipulate their coloration. By doing this, they mimic the appearance of their main prey’s parents. Orchid dottybacks prey on juvenile damselfish by pretending to be their parents, and it works! Scientists who studied the behavior of these purple tricksters discovered that when the dottybacks mimicked the damselfish, they were three times as successful in catching their prey. Sometimes, they even travel with schools of damselfish for easy access to prey. The only downside to their neat trick is that, unlike some other camouflaging marine creatures like squids , the dottybacks cannot change their colors instantly. It usually takes them many days to do so. Fridman’s dottybacks also use their obscuring talents to hide from their predators by camouflaging as their background. It has been observed that dottybacks would usually rather disguise themselves as damselfish to hunt prey than disguise themselves as their background to hide from predators. It is clear where their priorities lie. Orchid dottybacks are great starter fish for beginner fish owners. They are a hardy species and feeding them isn’t an issue since they eat just about anything. However, these fish are very territorial and can get aggressive with their space. Adding new fish to an aquarium with existing dottybacks may lead to bullying, so dottybacks are best added later to an already occupied tank. Orchid dottybacks should be kept in a lidded tank as well because they are very active and love to jump. They can become quite accustomed to their owners and are known to follow their them around in the tank when they pass by. Orchid dottybacks are rapacious predators for their small size. In the wild, they mostly prey on other smaller fish, primarily juvenile damselfish. These purple fish have quite the appetite and can eat as many as 30 damselfish every day. Orchid dottybacks are very opportunistic eaters. In captivity, they will eat just about anything presented to them. They especially love meaty food items such as brine shrimp , frozen mysis shrimp, plankton, and live worms . They will also eat fish flakes. The orchid dottyback is native to the Red Sea. The Red Sea is reputable for its salty water which is perfect for the dottyback. It prefers tropical water and loves to make its home in coral reefs , holes, crevices, and regions with abundant rocks. This dottyback lives in fairly shallow waters of up to 196.9 feet in depth. The orchid dottyback is also very popular as aquarium pets. They used to be expensive to obtain from their native region, but the appearance of breeders and aquarists helped lower the cost for pet owners. The exact population of the orchid dottyback is unknown, but the species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . The orchid dottyback is a protogynous hermaphrodite. This means that they are born with the sexual organs of both female and male and can choose which one to become. These fish are initially born female. The larger fish within a group would become the male. The sexual dimorphism in the Pseudochromis fridmani species is low. It is almost impossible to tell the males and females apart. At times, mature females have full bellies, slimmer males, but this isn’t in stone. Orchid dottybacks mate several times. The process starts when the male performs a mating dance outside his shelter to convince the female to enter. When she eventually does, she will lay up to 1,000 eggs. The male dottyback watches over the eggs until they hatch into babies called fry. They repeat the spawning process each week. Orchid dottybacks can live five to seven years in captivity and possible even longer when taken care of properly. Orchid dottybacks are small fish and as such are prey to larger marine animals such as eels, triggers, and lionfish . They might also be prone to saltwater fish diseases such as dropsy, marine ich, black ich, and ammonia poisoning."

    "Name": "Underwing Moth",
    "Features": "Colorful rear wing",
    "Fun_Fact": "Their colorful rear wing makes predators think that they are poisonous, however they are not it is a deceptive feature.",
    "Text": "The Catocala , also known as the underwing moth, is a genus of moths with bark-like forewings and very bright underwings. They are common in North America , Asia, and Europe and are known for their unique ability to camouflage with their environment and keep predators away by flashing their rear wings. Scientifically known as Catocala, the underwing moths are a genus that belongs to the family Erebidae. They were named by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1802. This genus contains at least 250-260 species of underwing moths. The name Catocala comes from two greek words – kato, meaning lower, and kalos meaning beautiful. This name comes from the beautiful rear wings of these moths. This name is pronounced as kah-TAH-kuh-luh. The underwing moths have very colorful and bright rear wings. Their forewings look like tree bark or leaves, which allows them to hide from their predators. On the other hand, their rear wings are bright in color and patterned in different ways. When camouflaging, they conceal their rear wings to prevent predators from seeing them. Their hind wings have stripes, which can vary in color to orange, pink, white, red, or black, depending on the species. When threatened, these moths show their rear wings, which throws off the enemy – a phenomenon known as deflective coloration . When flying, the underwing moths occasionally hide their rear wings in mid-air to deceive possible predators, also called flash coloration. These moths usually have a wingspan of about 2-5 inches, almost as long as a human thumb. The caterpillars of an underwing moth are grey or brown, allowing them to camouflage into their habitat. In addition, underwing moth larvae can change color to blend with their environment. The underwing moth is a nocturnal genus, meaning they spend the day resting on trees and the nights wandering. At night, they fly from tree to tree in search of food or, during the breeding season, a place to lay their eggs. This genus of moths is docile, and they tend to stick to themselves. So they do not fly in groups but remain solitary. They remain passive unless threatened or bothered, which is when they begin to move rapidly and show their rear wings. They also start flapping their wings so fast that it appears as though they are vibrating. Another behavior of the underwing moth is “playing dead.” They can become extraordinarily still if they feel threatened to try and cause predators to lose interest. Underwing moths also use camouflage to protect themselves. They only sit on trees that have the same color as their forewings, making them almost indistinguishable from the bark. It is thought that any loud noise triggers their sense of smell instead of a startled response. In addition, they have sensory organs that allow them to detect vibrations or sounds at a specific frequency, such as that of a bat , which is one of their main predators. Underwing moths live in forests with the same color bark as their wings, allowing them to camouflage effectively. This means that they typically thrive in deciduous trees. However, they can also be found in caves, under rocks and ledges, and in other bushes or areas that allow them to camouflage. The caterpillars of underwing moths live in tree canopies or soil. During the day, they hide at the trunk base, and at night they return to the tree to feed on the leaves. Almost half of all underwing moth species are found in North America, and the remaining species are found in Asia and Europe. In addition, a few unique species are found in the northern Neotropics and Indomalaya. Underwing moths are herbivores meaning that their diet is entirely based on plants. Most of the species feed on deciduous tree leaves in the forest. However, they can also feed on grass and other vegetation in their habitat. The underwing moths are preyed on by larger carnivorous animals and insectivores. These include, but are not limited to, birds, bats, lizards, and spiders. The moths often escape these predators by flashing their rear wings and rapidly flapping their wings. The bright color of their rear wings also gives some predators the impression that they are poisonous. However, they are not poisonous creatures. The primary food of an underwing moth varies depending on its habitat and the surrounding trees. But overall, this genus feeds on the leaves of the trees within their habitat, usually deciduous trees. They can also feed on grass and other plants within their habitat. Underwing moth caterpillars typically eat poplars and willows. Since underwing moths are tiny creatures, they are preyed on by many larger animals, such as birds, bats , lizards , and spiders . Predators aside, other threats that underwing moths face are habitat loss, deforestation, and pesticides. Too much artificial light and a sudden climate change also significantly affect their population. The underwing moth goes through a complete lifecycle before becoming fully grown. In the mating season, males locate the females by their pheromones. And once the mating process has occurred, the female lays her eggs soon after. In the summer, the female underwing moths deposit eggs on tree branches, either one at a time or in small clusters. These eggs only take 4-10 days to hatch if laid during the summer, but in winter, it can take up to 3 weeks. Once they hatch, they become a worm-like larva known as a caterpillar . At this stage of the cycle, they do not have wings. Instead, they wriggle around and hide on the branches of trees. After about one month, they become adult moths, and the cycle repeats. Baby underwing moths are called caterpillars and have elongated bodies with no wings. These are similar larvae to butterflies , except they are brown and grey instead, while butterfly caterpillars are more colorful. They eat plant material and leaves in their habitat and take about a month to fully mature. At the end of the caterpillar’s cycle, they form a chrysalis, and its body digests itself and forms an entirely new body with wings. The average lifespan of an underwing moth is not very long, only one to six months, after which they begin to wear out and spend less time flying. Towards the end of their lives, they become susceptible to some common ailments. These include: The overall population of the underwing moth genus is unknown. There are around 250-260 underwing moth species living all over the world, most of which have stable populations. However, two of their species in Missouri have a status of Vulnerable. The rest remain Least Concern , considering their rapid reproductive cycle."

    "Name": "African Wild Dog",
    "Features": "Four toes on each foot rather than five",
    "Fun_Fact": "Also known as the painted dog!",
    "Text": "The African Wild Dog (also known as the Painted Dog and the Cape Hunting Dog) is a medium-sized species of canine found across sub-Saharan Africa. The African Wild Dog is most easily identified from both domestic and other wild Dogs by its brightly mottled fur, with its name in scientific name, Lycaon pictus , aptly meaning painted wolf . It is the only member of the genus Lycaon still in existence. There are five subspecies of Lycaon pictus currently listed, but there is scientific debate about the classifications, so they may change in time : The African Wild Dog, or its ancestors, has been around for a very, very long time. The species genetically diverged from other canids over 1.7 million years ago. Fossils show evidence of Lycaon pictus 200,000 years ago in the area of modern-day Israel. The dogs were known and depicted in art in ancient Egypt. They were also mentioned in literature dating back to the second and third centuries. Through the centuries, they have evolved well to adapt to their needs and environment. These evolutionary change include their coloring, which serves as camouflage and as a temperature regulator, their teeth, and their feet have all evolved. Most canines have five toes on both their front and back feet, but the African Wild Dog lost the first digit on its forefeet to expand its stride and speed and to make it easier to pursue prey across open plains for long distances. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The most distinctive feature of the African Wild Dog is its beautifully mottled fur which makes this canine very easy to identify. The fur of the African Wild Dog is red, black, white, brown and yellow in colour with the random pattern of colours being unique to each individual. It is also thought to act as a type of camouflage, helping the African Wild Dog to blend into its surroundings. The African Wild Dog also has large ears, a long muzzle and long legs, with four toes on each foot. This is one of the biggest differences between the African Wild Dog and other canine species as they have five. They also have a large stomach and a long, large intestine which aids them in more effectively absorbing moisture from their food. African Wild Dogs are found naturally roaming the deserts, open-plains and arid savanna of sub-Saharan Africa where the range of the African Wild Dog has decreased rapidly. It is thought that the African Wild Dog was once found in nearly 40 different African countries but that number is much lower today, at between 10 and 25. Now most African Wild Dog populations are primarily restricted to National Parks across southern Africa, with the highest populations found in Botswana and Zimbabwe . African Wild Dogs require large territories to support the pack, with pack sizes having in fact dropped in number with their decreasing home-ranges. African Wild Dogs are highly intelligent and sociable animals that gather in packs of generally between 10 and 30 individuals. There is a strict ranking system within the pack, led by the dominant breeding pair. They are the world’s most sociable dogs and do everything as a group, from hunting for and sharing food, to helping sick members and assisting in raising young. African Wild Dogs communicate between one another through touch, movement and sound. Pack members are incredibly close, gathering together before a hunt to nose and lick each other, whilst wagging their tails and making high-pitched noises. African Wild Dogs lead a crepuscular lifestyle meaning that they are most active during dawn and dusk. You can check out incredible facts about African wild dogs . In African Wild Dog packs, there is usually only one breeding pair, which are the dominant male and female members. After a gestation period of around 70 days, the female African Wild Dog gives birth to between 2 and 20 pups in a den, which she remains in with her young for the first few weeks, relying on the other pack members to provide her with food. The African Wild Dog cubs leave the den at between 2 and 3 months old and are fed and cared for by the entire pack until they are old enough to become independent and generally leave to join or start another African Wild Dog pack. It is thought that the more looked after the pups are, the higher their chances of survival. The African Wild Dog is a carnivorous and opportunistic predator, hunting larger animals on the African plains in their big groups. African Wild Dogs primarily prey on large mammals such as Warthogs and numerous species of Antelope , supplementing their diet with Rodents, Lizards, Birds and Insects. They are even known to hunt much larger herbivores that have been made vulnerable through sickness or injury, such as Wildebeest . Although the African Wild Dog’s prey is often much faster, the chase can last for miles, and it is this Dog’s stamina and perseverance that makes them so successful, along with their ability to maintain their speed. Hunting as a pack also means that the African Wild Dogs can easily corner their prey. Due to the relatively large size and dominant nature of the African Wild Dog and their pack, they have few natural predators within their native habitats. Lions and Hyenas have been known on occasion, to prey on African Wild Dog individuals that have been separated from the rest of the group. One of the biggest threats to the African Wild Dog are farmers who hunt and kill the African Wild Dog in fear that they are preying on their livestock. The slightly savage nature of the African Wild Dog has led to superstitions regarding it, with locals having almost wiped out entire populations in certain areas. The loss of their historical ranges, generally due to growing human settlements, has pushed the remaining African Wild Dog populations into small pocket of their native regions. Although the majority of the African Wild Dog population is today confined to National Parks, they tend to require much larger territories and come into conflict with humans when they leave these protected areas. These dogs are also subject to diseases carried by livestock, and that causes further population decline. Today, the African Wild Dog is listed as an Endangered species by the IUCN . There are thought to be only about 6600 individuals left roaming sub-Saharan Africa today, with numbers still declining."

    "Name": "Hoary Bat",
    "Features": "The white-tipped fur",
    "Fun_Fact": "The hoary bat travels hundreds of miles south for the winter",
    "Text": "This forest-dwelling hoary bat comes out at night to feed on insects , using its echolocation to locate prey. These bats are a member of the vesper bat family. Vesper means “evening” in Latin, which perfectly encapsulates their preferred time of the day. The hoary bat has the largest range of any bat species in the Americas. It can be found in many different habitats between northern Canada and Argentina . Whereas many species of bats congregate together in vast colonies, the hoary bat prefers to roost and even sometimes hunt alone outside of the annual migration season. The scientific name of the hoary bat is Lasiurus cinereus . A member of the vesper bat family, the genus name Lasiurus means hairy tail in Greek. This is an apt description, because the dozen or so members of the genus, including the eastern red bat and the western red bat, have a conspicuous hairy tail. The species name of cinereus is derived from a Latin word meaning ashen or ash-like. This is a clear reference to the white-tipped fur. There are three recognized subspecies of hoary bats, about which more will be said in the habitat section. A quick note on the bat’s taxonomy: some experts advocate that the hoary bat should represent its own genus, distinct yet closely related to hair-tailed bats, with each subspecies being an independent species, but this standard is not yet widely accepted. Apart from the blunt and rounded nose, short ears, and hairy tail, the easiest way to identify this species from other types of bats is their unique fur color. They sport brown-gray fur with white tips, giving them the appearance of frost or ash, while the neck has a unique yellow “mane” wrapped around the entire head. The hoary bat is also a relatively large member of its genus. Measuring about 5 to 6 inches from nose to tail, with a relatively lightweight of around an ounce, the body of this bat is about the same size as a big mouse . With its wings fully extended, the entire length of the bat measures about 17 inches from tip to tip. The weight of the female is about 40% heavier than the male. The hoary bat spends most of the daytime roosting alone and then comes out to hunt shortly after sunset. They can be seen soaring and gliding around treetops, streams, lakeshores, and sometimes even urban areas, looking for insects to consume. While they do sometimes form temporary groups to hunt at night, hoary bats are largely solitary in nature. Their territorial instincts seem to intensify during moments of food scarcity. They make shrill hissing sounds and bare their teeth when guarding their favorite hunting grounds. Although some members of this species do stay in the north to hibernate, most hoary bats will undertake an epic migration in the fall. Hundreds of these bats will travel together from the northern United States and Canada to the southern US and Central America . Regardless of where they live, hoary bats have a specific strategy to deal with cold weather. When the temperature drops, they can slow their metabolism and wrap their hairy tail around their bodies for insulation to stay warm. The hoary bat prefers to roost in large trees with dense foliage. This may include coniferous trees, broadleaf trees, heavily mixed forests, open wooded glades, cloud forests, lowland deserts, tundra, and even trees along urban streets and city parks. Regardless, they aren’t particularly choosey about where they roost. They’ve been found in squirrel nests, woodpecker holes, buildings, and caves. The hoary bat has three distinct subspecies. One subspecies called L. cinereus cinereus is found across much of North America , from Canada to Guatemala . They’re even thought to occur in Alaska , though actual populations have yet to be found there. Another subspecies called L. cinereus villosissimus has a natural range across parts of South America , including the distant Galapagos Islands. The third and final subspecies called L. cinereus semotus is found only in Hawaii ; it’s one of the few bat species native to the tropical island chain. The hoary bat is currently threatened by predators, overuse of pesticides, the loss of roosting sites and tree cover, and collision with wind turbines and other manmade objects, which appear to affect this species more than any other bat, perhaps because it mistakes the turbine for a place to roost. More responsible tree management, new wind turbine technologies, and better conservation practices, in general, should help to maintain existing population numbers. White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that has devastated bat numbers in the eastern United States , doesn’t appear to be a significant cause of mortality for the hoary bat. There may be two reasons for this. First, white-nose syndrome is spread by close contact, and the hoary bat is mostly solitary. Second, the fungus itself doesn’t kill the bat directly but instead disturbs the bat’s natural hibernation cycle, which causes it to starve or freeze to death. The hoary bat, by contrast, prefers to migrate south for the winter. The hoary bat is preyed upon by hawks, owls, kestrels, and snakes . The bat’s fur color provides a degree of camouflage while it’s roosting in trees. The hoary bat feeds almost entirely on insects . Moths appear to account for most of its diet, but it also consumes flies , beetles , grasshoppers , termites , dragonflies , and wasps . As mentioned previously, it consumes 40% of its body weight per meal. There is a lot we still don’t understand about the reproduction of the hoary bat because few people have ever actually seen them mate. But it’s believed that they reproduce sometime around August, either before, during, or after their annual migration. Mating itself probably takes place in the air. After they copulate, the female has the remarkable ability to delay fertilization of the egg by storing the sperm for the winter. Thus, while the gestation period only lasts for a few weeks or months, the female does not give birth until the following late spring or early summer. The mother will produce around two (and sometimes up to four) pups at a time while she hangs upside down in her roost. She has two pairs of teats to wean all of them at once. The pups are born with brown skin, shading to pale around the head and short tufts of fine silvery fur. They are completely helpless because their eyes and ears are closed for the first few days of their lives. They spend the day clinging to the mother as she sleeps. At night they hang from a twig or leaf as the mother goes out hunting. Mothers will develop a basic relationship with their pups. She has the ability to recognize their calls, especially when they’re in distress. Some mothers will change roosts frequently with their pups. This is the only time she will actually take them with her on a flight. It takes about a month for the pups to begin flying on their own. By around day 45, they can fly nearly as well as the adults. Their lifespan hasn’t been well-documented, but with the burden of predators and disease, it’s estimated that they only live some six or seven years in the wild, while the average lifespan may be no more than two years. The migratory period seems to be the most dangerous period. Many fall victim to predators, accidents, or collisions during this time. The hoary bat is currently classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. It’s unknown how many hoary bats live in the wild, but the best estimate suggests there are around 2.5 million in North America alone. Local populations (particularly in places like the Galapagos Islands and the Pacific Northwest) may be threatened by human activity. The Hawaii subspecies is specifically classified as endangered . There is, unfortunately, a lot of information lacking about this species, so conservationists are focused on accumulating more data in order to improve efforts at rehabilitation."

    "Name": "Cuttlefish",
    "Text": "Equipped with flexible tentacles, ink production capabilities, and a keen intelligence, the cuttlefish is a remarkable creature of the sea. Despite the name, it is not really a fish at all, but a type of cephalopod. This puts it in the same class as the squid , nautilus, and octopus . It is often said that the cephalopods resemble aliens on Earth in the sense that it’s a remarkably intelligent but very different type of lifeform from us. They last shared a common ancestor with land animals some hundreds of millions of years ago. 5 Incredible Cuttlefish Facts Want more cuttlefish facts?

The term Sepiida derives from the Greek and Latin word sepia , which is a reference to the name of the dye produced from its ink. Sepia is now the English word for a type of reddish-brown color. There are approximately 120 species of cuttlefish still alive. Here is just a small sample of them: Cuttlefish are some of the most ancient living creatures that swim the oceans today. Scientists believe the first cuttlefish began to emerge from their progenetors sometime 500 million years ago. Early cuttlefish greatly resembled their cousin the nautilus, being encased in a similar protective shell. Soon ancient cuttlefish began to develop the trait of camouflage, fine-tuning and perfecting their tactics for blending in with their environment for millions of years until shell was no longer necessary for their survival. Cuttlefish are able to use their camouflage by activating the 20 million chromatosphores on their skin- these are specialized cells that control pigmentation. In addition to defending themselves from predators, cuttlefish have also evolved to use their color changing skin for communicating with other members of their species, with males often showcasing a complex pageant of color patterns in order to attract a mate. One look at this fish will tell you that it’s a true cephalopod. Its body resembles the closely related squid and octopus , except it is much smaller in size. The smallest cuttlefish species only measure an inch or two. The largest species is the Australian giant cuttlefish, which can measure up to 20 inches and weigh about 23 pounds. The cuttlefish is characterized by the gas-filled internal cuttlebone (which actually provides buoyancy and control rather than protection), a long and relatively flat body, a parrot-like beak, and long fins running along both sides. It also features eight arms and two tentacles containing a series of suction pads that are used to capture prey. The arms and tentacles can be withdrawn into two pouches at any time. Cuttlefish are also one of the few animals that have multiple hearts . In total, they have three different hearts! Two of those hearts supply blue-green blood to its gills while the third supplies oxygen to the rest of its body. Why is its blood blue-green instead of red? Because cuttlefish blood contains hemocyanin which itself contains copper, rather than hemoglobin which contains iron. The cuttlefish moves at incredible speeds through the water via jet propulsion. It does this by sucking in water through a body cavity and then expelling the water out with its powerful muscles. The fins allow it to maneuver at high speeds. This method of transportation is necessary to evade very fast and agile predators. Another incredible ability is the color change. The cuttlefish body contains millions of small pigment cells called chromatophores that allow the creature to alter its color and pattern at any time. When the cuttlefish flexes its muscles, the pigment is released into the outer skin to blend in with the surroundings. This is used for many purposes such as to camouflage itself, attract mates, and communicate with other cuttlefish. The color change may also serve the purpose of stunning prey with quick and debilitating flashes. The cuttlefish has a rather large brain-to-body size compared to most invertebrates. Studies reveal that it is capable of various degrees of problem-solving and object manipulation. This intelligence may be necessary to manipulate the incredibly complex tentacles and arms, which contain a large number of neurons like the brain. The cuttlefish is found throughout the oceans and seas of Europe , Africa , Asia , and Australia, but it is largely absent from the Americas. Throughout its natural range, this animal exhibits a yearly migratory pattern. In the summer, it inhabits the coastal waters in tropical or temperate regions. In the winter, it migrates to the deeper water of the oceans. According to the IUCN Red List, which keeps track of the conservation status of many animals, data about population numbers is unfortunately not available for many cuttlefish species. When data is known, almost all species are categorized as least concern . Only a few species are at risk of endangerment. The cuttlefish has a rather simple diet consisting of fish , crab , and other mollusks. Larger cuttlefish also have the tendency to prey on juveniles or smaller species of cuttlefish. They use the beak located in the mantle between their arms to crack open the tough shells of their prey and feast on the tasty meat within. For a full analysis of what cuttlefish eat, we’ve published ‘ What Do Cuttlefish Eat? The 10 Favorites of Their Diets .’ Due to its small size, the cuttlefish is hunted by all kinds of larger fish, dolphins , seals , birds , and other mollusks. But it does have several defensive mechanisms to help it survive. When threatened, the cuttlefish can release a cloud of ink to confuse predators and then make its daring escape. The speed is a distinct advantage over slower predators. The venom of some species also provides a valuable defense. The cuttlefish has a very organized and straightforward reproduction cycle. During the breeding season, which lasts between the spring and summer of every year, the male puts on a brilliant mating display in which it transforms colors and patterns to impress the female. Once accepted, the male uses its modified arm to transfer sperm into the female’s mantle near the mouth to fertilize the eggs. The impregnated female then deposits 100 to 300 eggs at a time on rocks, seaweed, or other surfaces. She alone watches over the eggs until they hatch after a period of one or two months on average. Shortly after their duties are fulfilled, both the male and female will die, ceding the way to the next generation. Cuttlefish reach sexual maturity after a period lasting up to 18 months, but their life expectancy is a mere one or two years of age. This means they tend to perish after only a single mating season. Cuttlefish is a popular dish throughout the coastal regions of Europe and East Asia. It is prepared in various ways: breaded, deep fried, grilled, or shredded. The ink can be served alone or with the rest of the cuttlefish as well. Earlier on we touched on some of the most notable species of cuttlefish, below you can find a comprehensive list of every type of this camoflauging cephalopod:"

    "Name": "Green Bottle Blue Tarantula",
    "Features": "Bright color combination",
    "Fun_Fact": "The spiderlings look very different than the adults.",
    "Text": "A beautiful green, blue and orange tarantula. Green bottle blue tarantulas are vibrant green and burnt orange with bright blue legs. Their carapace is covered in greenish bristles/hairs and their abdomen is covered in orange bristles that look almost like fur. While you can barely see some tarantula’s eyes, green bottle blue has two prominent black eyes that make them look somewhat cartoonish. The other six eyes are also present but not as large. Exotic pet owners like to display the green bottle blue due to their bright coloration. The scientific name of the green bottle blue tarantula is Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens. They are actually the only member of their genus. Chroma means “colored” in Latin and pelma means “fur” . Cyan refers to their coloration being greenish-blue. Sometimes they are just called by their abbreviation GBB or their location, Venezuelan green bottle blue. These colorful tarantulas have a greenish carapace (head section) and an orangish abdomen (back section). Their legs add even more color with eight bright blue legs. Their bodies and legs are covered in bristles that look like fur, especially on their abdomen. Two of their eyes are larger than the others and clearly poke out of the top of their heads. The spiderlings also have a very unique look. When they are born they look very different. They are not born green, blue and orange. They are born with dark brown abdomens and have pink legs. Their bellies have alternating red and black stripes. Their coloration changes with each moly until they match the adult green, blue and orange version. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . As adults they can get to be around 2.75 inches with a leg span as much as 6 inches or more. In comparison, according to a study by NASA , the average adult hand size for men is 7.6 inches and women 6.8 inches. So these are about hand-sized spiders . Green bottle blue tarantulas are skittish and are observed scurrying around their enclosures when captive. They are fast and capable of climbing trees quickly. They spend most of their tim on the ground but are considered semi arboreal so they can spend time on lower branches or in bushes. Some tarantulas do not spin webs to catch prey, but GBB’s are webbers and often fill their enclosures with multiple webs. In the wild they will often create a burrow filled with webs and a web “door” covering the entrance. To make room for their growing bodies they must molt their exoskeleton. Prior to their molt they stop eating and get lethargic. After a molt is when you see some of the most brightly displayed colors. As New World tarantulas they use the similar technique as other tarantulas and can flick the urticating hairs off their back. These bristly hairs can cause pain and irritation in the victim or predator. Green bottle blue tarantulas are from South America on the Paraguana Peninsula in Venezuela. They are terrestrial but also semi-arboreal, meaning they spend most of the time on the ground of the forests but can also climb and make webs in lower branches of trees and shrubs. Their homes are burrows around downed tree branches, stumps and brush. They create many webs both inside and outside of their burrows for protection and to catch insects and other small animals for dinner. The funnel shaped webs also help protect the spiders from the elements. In captivity owners keep their enclosures between 75°-85° and relatively humid to mimic the tropical climate of Venezuela. The main predators of green bottle blue tarantulas are larger spiders, lizards , snakes and birds. Venezuela has an enormous variety of animals that live in the hot humid forests and deserts . Green bottle blues need to protect themselves from predators by hiding in burrows during the day and creating large webs to deter predators. If threatened they will either flick their urticating hairs at a predator or they will flee…quickly! They have options of burrowing, finding a web to hide behind or hightailing it up a nearby tree. Their unique coloration actually provides great camouflage when mixed in with the flora of their surroundings. As a last resort they can use their fangs to bite in self-defense and they are venomous, however they mainly use their fangs and venom to subdue prey before eating. The main animals that eat Green bottle blue tarantulas are arboreal snakes, birds and larger spiders. Green bottle blue tarantulas eat insects, small birds, worms and small mice. Whatever happens to wander into their webs and get caught. In captivity they can be fed crickets , meal worms or dubia roaches. They may eat 5-7 large crickets every 2-3 weeks or 2 dubia roaches ever y 2-3 weeks. Before they molt they may refuse to eat altogether and go for weeks without food. Green bottle blue tarantulas are not listed by the IUCN as a threatened species. Reproduction for tarantulas is a delicate dance with the main goal of the males to pass on their genes without getting eaten. In captivity female green bottle greens are very picky and will not mate with just any male put in their enclosure. It is assumed that females in the wild are also choosey. Their unique coloration may play a role in mate choice. If a male green bottle blue finds a receptive mate he will spin a sperm web and then transfer his sperm to the female. They then know to immediately get away to avoid being eaten. After they mate the males do end their life cycle and die within a few weeks to months. Female green bottle blue tarantulas lay around 100 eggs. They wrap them up with their webs to create an egg sac. About 10 weeks later the little spiderlings hatch. They are not green, blue and orange, but dark brown with pink legs and red/black striping. The spiderlings only stick around for a couple of days before instinctually knowing the mother will eat them. They take off to make new homes of their own. The life span of female green bottle blue tarantulas is 12-14 years while males have a much shorter lifespan. Males live for 3-4 years. It is uncertain the population of green bottle blue tarantulas. They are not listed by the IUCN. They are allowed to be kept as pets in the US and are a “display pet” as handling is not recommended."

    "Name": "White Tiger",
    "Features": "White fur with bright, blue eyes",
    "Fun_Fact": "None have been seen in the wild for 50 years!",
    "Text": "The White Tiger (also known as the White Bengal Tiger) is a subspecies of Tiger, found throughout the Indian subcontinent. Although the range of the White Tiger is historically very large, these animals are incredibly rare as their coloration is dependent on a defective, recessive gene that is passed on from their parents. Over the past couple of centuries, the White Tiger has become even rarer in the wild due to trophy hunting or capture for the exotic pet trade, with there having been no recorded sightings of these elusive predators for the past 50 years. Today, the White Tiger is an animal that can still be found in a handful of zoos and animal sanctuaries around the world with these large and beautiful felines often being the star attraction. Along with the Bengal Tiger , the White Tiger is considered to be the second largest species of Tiger in the world after the Siberian Tiger. White tigers are leucistic forms of any one of the five populations: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The White Tiger is a large and powerful animal that can weigh up to 300kg and reaches more than 3 meters in length. Unlike the white variations found in other animal species, the White Tiger is not an albino as they still carry some form of pigment that creates their fur color, and some individuals are known to retain an orange tinge to their white-colored fur. Like other Tiger species, the White Tiger has black or dark brown stripes that run vertically along its body, the pattern of which is unique to both the Tiger species and the individual. Along with the change in fur color, the gene carried by the White Tiger’s parents also means that they have blue eyes rather than the green or yellow colored eyes of normal Bengal Tigers. Despite the beauty of the White Tiger’s fur, it does in fact give these individuals a disadvantage as they are not so easily camouflaged into the surrounding jungle. The White Tiger is an animal that would once have been found throughout much of India and the surrounding countries but its range has decreased dramatically, particularly over the past 100 years or so. Today the Bengal Tiger is found in small pockets of its natural habitat in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, and although populations are severely declining, they remain the most numerous Tiger species in the world. They are found in a variety of habitats including tropical forests, mangrove swamps, and moist jungles that generally support dense vegetation and have a good source of fresh water. Although the White Tiger could once be found in the wild, it is very rare for the gene-carrying parents to actually mate, and with the rapidly declining numbers of Bengal Tigers throughout their natural range, the chances of White Tigers being produced are becoming less every day. Like other Tiger species, the White Tiger is a solitary animal as this allows this large predator to sneak up on prey more effectively in the dense jungle. Although the White Tiger is not nocturnal, they carry out the majority of their hunting at night as this also helps them to hunt more successfully. White Tigers have incredible hearing and sight which, along with their stealth, helps them when hunting in the jungle in the dark. Each Tiger occupies a large territory that is marked by urine and claw marks on trees, and can be up to 75 square miles in size. Despite the fact that they are solitary animals except for during the mating season, male White Tiger territories can overlap with those of a number of females’, particularly in areas which are high in prey. Male White Tigers will however, defend their patch fiercely from other males who may be trying to steal their spot. In order for a White Tiger to be produced, both of its parents must carry the gene. Male and female White Tigers attract each other by roaring and scent marks, and once mated, the male and female go their separate ways. After a gestation period that lasts for around 3 and a half months, the female White Tiger gives birth to up to 5 cubs, which are blind and weigh roughly 1kg each and can have either white or orange fur. The White Tiger cubs suckle on the milk from their mother and begin to eat meat that she has caught for them when they are around 2 months old, and are weaned four months later. The White Tiger cubs begin to accompany their mother hunting and eventually leave her and begin their solitary life in the jungle when they are about 18 months of age. White Tigers have an average lifespan of 12 years, which can be longer in captivity. In the same way as other Tiger species, the White Tiger is a carnivorous animal meaning that it only hunts and eats other animals in order to gain the nutrition that it needs. The White Tiger is an apex predator in its environment, hunting its prey by stalking it stealthily in the darkness of night. The White Tiger primarily hunts large, herbivorous animals including Deer , Wild Boar, Cattle and Goats that feed both in the jungle and on its outskirts. The White Tiger has a number of adaptations to help it to both catch and kill its prey, including being strong and powerful, incredibly fast, and having long and sharp claws and teeth.With growing Human settlements pushing the White Bengal Tiger into smaller and smaller pockets of its historical range, they are also commonly known to hunt and kill livestock, with entrances into villages also becoming increasingly common. In its natural environment, the White Tiger has no predators due to the fact that it is such a big and powerful animal itself. They are however severely affected by people and have been for hundreds of years, as they have been both captured and hunted for their beauty, and have lost a significant chunk of their historical range to deforestation for both growing Human settlements and agriculture. With the loss in forest, there is also a decline in the White Tiger’s prey so populations are becoming increasingly harder to sustain. The fact that the few Bengal Tigers that remain in the wild are becoming more and more isolated means that there is less of a chance that White Tigers will be produced, and this coupled with the severe declines in population numbers could mean that White Tigers have disappeared from the wild forever. Oddly enough, the White Tiger is thought to have a slightly shorter life expectancy than the normal Bengal Tiger. Although there is no evidence of this in the wild, captive studies conclude that it is due to the White Tiger’s mutated genes and to the inbreeding that is required to continue breeding the White Tiger in captivity. One of the biggest reasons for White Tiger’s becoming rarer and rarer in the wild is the fact that they were often captured by the rich, who kept them as an incredibly exotic pet. The White Tiger is one of the most versatile and adaptable predators in the Asian jungle as they are not only incredibly quick and agile at running, but they are also very capable swimmers, allowing them to breech natural boundaries such as rivers and wetland. Since they were first brought into captivity, White Tigers have been interbred by Humans in a business that is morally questionable and purely profit based. Since then, this already rare animal is thought to have disappeared completely as there have been no confirmed White Tiger reports since the mid 1900s. Although it is simply a question of two gene carrying individuals mating, the fact that people have hunted them and taken over much of their natural habitat, means that the chances of this happening are not very high. There is an issue however, with increasing instances of Bengal Tigers actually entering Human settlements which causes problems between the Tiger and the villagers. Due to the fact that Tigers are becoming increasingly more vulnerable animals, it is illegal to shoot them and so they often return to the same village night after night. The White Tiger is a Bengal Tiger which is a species listed by the IUCN as Endangered and therefore severely threatened in its surrounding environment. Estimates of around 100,000 Tigers found in the jungles and mangrove swamps of Asia were made at the beginning of the 1900s, but today there are thought to be less than 8,000 Tigers in the wild, with around 2,000 of these being Bengal Tigers. There are no White Tiger individuals known to be found outside of captivity. Read more about the population of white tigers ."

    "Name": "Cinnamon Bear",
    "Features": "Cinnamon-colored fur",
    "Fun_Fact": "A newborn cinnamon bear weighs 1/2 pound -- about the same as a large apple.",
    "Text": "“Cinnamon bear cubs don’t always look like their moms. They can be black, brown, or reddish-brown.” Cinnamon bears are named for the warm brown color of their fur. They are a subspecies of the North American black bear . Besides their color, this species differs from black bears in that they tend to be found in more arid climates. But these bears may coexist in the same habitats and interbreed. When they do, they may have cubs that are black, brown, or reddish-brown. Although their habitat is not as large as it once was, these bears are not considered an endangered species at this time. The scientific name is Ursus americanus cinnamomum . It is from the Ursidae family of the Mammalia class. These beautiful bears have brown or reddish-brown fur that looks like cinnamon spice. Its coat is thicker, longer, and finer than that of the black bear. Their size is comparable to that of black bears. They stand 3 feet high at the shoulder when they are down on all fours, and they weigh anywhere from 200-600 pounds. Males are larger than females. The bears are heavier when food is abundant, especially in the fall when they pack on pounds to prepare for hibernation . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Cubs weigh only half a pound at birth! That’s about the weight of one large apple. Like other bears, they are nocturnal – they sleep during the day and become active at night. They are especially active around dawn and dusk, and are great climbers, runners, and swimmers. These bears are usually solitary creatures, with the exception of mothers who are still nursing cubs. They hibernate during the winter. Depending on how cold the weather is, they start hibernating in late October or early November and don’t emerge from their dens until March or April. They live mainly in forests in both the lowlands and mountains. They tend to be more common in drier, more arid regions, while black bears prefer moister forest conditions. The brown fur of the cinnamon bear provides advantageous camouflage against a background of dry grasses, dead tree limbs, and exposed rocks. Cinnamon bears are omnivores. They like fruit, vegetation, nuts and honey. They also eat insects, fish , small rodents, or carrion from dead animals they find in the woods. A full-grown adult doesn’t have any major natural predators in its habitat, but mountain lions , wolves , or coyotes may take advantage of sick cubs or injured adults. Humans are their main threat, due to encroachment on their habitat and hunting. Additionally, bears crossing roads or train tracks at night may collide with unsuspecting vehicles. Sometimes landowners will kill trespassing bears because they see them as a nuisance or a threat to pets, children, and livestock. Poaching for profit is also a problem. Poachers sell bear paws and gall on the black market where they fetch a high price for use in traditional Asian medicine. Females are sexually mature at 4-5 years old, while males become mature at 5-6 years old. The mating season is from June-July. After eggs are fertilized, they do not implant in the womb until the fall. This gives the mother time to build up her fat reserves to keep her babies healthy during hibernation. Gestation lasts 7 months. Usually, the mother has 2-3 cubs in January or February during hibernation. Cubs vary in color from black to brown to reddish-brown. They stay with their mother and nurse from her for around 17 months before going off on their own. The typical lifespan of a wild cinnamon bear is 30 years. It’s uncertain how many are in the wild, but they are not thought to be endangered. For comparison, the estimated population of the much more common North American black bear is 800,000. Cinnamon bears are found most commonly in the Rocky Mountains of the western United States and Canada. Their main habitat is in Colorado , New Mexico, Utah , Idaho , Nevada , Montana , Washington, Wyoming , California , Alberta, Manitoba, and British Columbia. However, they are also present in wilderness areas of eastern North America, including Pennsylvania , Tennessee , New York, Ontario, and Quebec. Larger populations have been noted in the Baniff and Jasper National Parks, Canada."

    "Name": "Snowshoe Hare",
    "Features": "Large hind feet",
    "Fun_Fact": "An adult snowshoe hare can cover ten feet in a single jump.",
    "Text": "A snowshoe hare can run as fast as 27mph. Snowshoe hares live in the northern United States as well as all over Canada. They are herbivores eating flowers, grass, leafy plants, and bark. While their coats are bright white in the wintertime, they turn brown in the spring. Snowshoe hares sleep on and off during the day and are active at dawn and dusk. They can live up to five years in the wild. Lepus americanus is the scientific name of a snowshoe hare. The word Lepus is Latin for hare and americanus is Latin for American. They are members of the Leporidae family and the class Mammalia. These animals have two long ears, a tail, and four feet with a thick layer of fur on them. They have a bright white coat in the winter that changes to brown or gray for the spring and summer. This change allows them to blend in with their snowy environment in the winter and disappear among the brush and trees throughout the other seasons. This camouflage is one of the ways they can stay clear of predators. Adults can measure up to 20 inches in length and weigh up to 4 pounds. A 20-inch snowshoe hare is equal in length to one and one third the size of a bowling pin. A 4-pound snowshoe hare weighs about the same as a Chihuahua . Compare the snowshoe hare with the Arctic hare . Both of these hares have a bright white coat, but Arctic hares weigh 6 to 15 pounds and grow to be 19 to 26 inches in size. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Another defensive feature (besides blending in with its environment) of a snowshoe hare is its speed. This hare can run at speeds up to 27mph. Also, this mammal can switch directions in a split second. So, this hare can not only outrun most predators, but it can also confuse them by taking a sudden turn and dashing off in another direction. Young snowshoes or leverets are known to freeze when they see a predator. This may be because they don’t yet have the full speed and coordination of an adult hare. They freeze in the hope of blending in with their habitat until the predator passes by. These hares are good swimmers. They may even swim across a stream or river in an effort to escape a predator. Who knew?! Snowshoes are solitary animals though there are usually other hares living in an area nearby. They are shy animals preferring to hide in the brush. When out looking for food, these hares use their excellent hearing to continually monitor their environment for threats. If hares ever do form a group, it’s called a drove. The back feet of these hares are especially large with a layer of stiff hair covering them. In fact, look at this hare’s feet and you may think it is wearing a pair of snowshoes! Their back feet can measure up to 6 inches long. The 6-inch foot of a snowshoe hare is about as long as a single dollar bill. Feet of this size help them to move on the surface of the snow. This makes their tracks easy to find! The thick, stiff fur on their feet helps to keep them warm in frigid temperatures. These hares live in the northern region of the United States and all over Canada . They live in a temperate climate and are active throughout the year. They live in forests, open fields, riverside thickets and near fencerows. Forests in the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains are home to many snowshoe hares. They don’t dig burrows and tunnels like rabbits. Instead, they find shelter in lower areas above ground or beneath thickets. A snowshoe moves around but stays within about a 20-acre range of space throughout the year. They eat the plant life that’s most plentiful at the time. Whether it’s winter or summer, scientists have observed snowshoe hare tracks on the same trails as these animals search for food. Snowshoe hares are herbivores . The diet of this animal is diverse. In summer they eat herbaceous plants and the new growth of woody vegetation. In winter, they eat twigs, buds, and bark. Snowshoe plants to eat in both early morning and at dusk. Some snowshoe hares search for food alone while others form small groups. These animals are fast, which is fortunate because they are a popular target for many predators. Snowshoe hares have several predators including wolves , owls , coyotes , lynx , bobcat , and red fox . Snowshoe hares are the main food source of lynx. When these hares are out in a field or the forest eating grass and plants, they are vulnerable to fast predators such as coyotes, lynx, foxes, wolves, and bobcats. Owls out hunting for prey can spot snowshoe hares feasting on plants in the evening and silently swoop down to capture one. Snowshoe hares have a diet of grass, plants and flowers in the spring and summer. When plants are harder to find in the cold weather months, these hares may eat tree bark, twigs, leaves and stems. Snowshoe hares are known to eat their own solid waste. They do this because they aren’t able to get all of the nutrients out of the food they eat by digesting it just one time. They eat their waste to get any remaining nutrients from their food. Snowshoe hares are vulnerable to habitat loss in some areas. Also, during certain seasons, some people participate in hunting for them to eat their meat. Despite these threats, the official conservation status of this hare is Least Concern with a stable population. Breeding season for the snowshoe hare runs through spring and summer. Both male and female snowshoe hares have multiple partners throughout their lives. When trying to find a mate, male hares chase females around the area. Both males and females jump vertically in the air and stare each other down. Once a female is pregnant, the gestation period is around 37 days. She prepares a nest made of grass that is smashed flat on the ground. She chases the male away if he enters what’s known as the birthing area. The female hare gives live birth to a litter of 1 to 8 babies. A baby hare is also called a leveret until the age of one year old. They weigh a little over one ounce at birth. A female snowshoe hare can have up to 4 litters of young in one year. She has sole care of the leverets from birth. When snowshoe hares are born they have all of their fur, their eyes are open, and they’re able to move around. Baby snowshoe rabbits, or leverets, spend the daytime hidden in the weeds. They are born in the spring and summer, so they have a brown coat that helps to camouflage them. At dusk, they go to their mother to nurse for a very short length of time before hiding again. When the leverets are around 14 days old, they begin to eat small plants and are fully weaned at 28 days. They become independent at about 4 weeks of age. Tularemia is a common disease of these hares. This disease can lead to anemia. It’s transmitted through ticks. The hare can live up to 5 years in the wild. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species doesn’t list a total population for snowshoe hares. But, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) has some data regarding this hare’s population there. Every ten years the population of this hare reaches its highest, then drops off. Scientists believe this decrease is due to disease that runs through the population. However, in plentiful years, the MDNR estimates there are approximately 3,400 snowshoe hares per square mile of the state! In short, after a decrease in the population, this species fully recovers due to the fact that a female hare can have up to 4 litters of young per year. The official conservation status of the snowshoe hare is Least Concern with a stable population."

    "Name": "Ocelot",
    "Features": "Rosettes, spots and stripes on fur",
    "Fun_Fact": "Also known as the Painted Leopard!",
    "Text": "The Ocelot is a medium-sized small cat that is native to the jungles of South America. The Ocelot is also known as the Painted Leopard due to the beautifully distinctive markings on its fur as it displays dark rosettes, along with spots and stripes. Similar in coloration to the much smaller but closely related Margay, the Ocelot is an animal that was nearly driven to extinction in the 20th century as they were commonly hunted for their fur. Today, however, national protection throughout much of their natural range has meant that the Ocelot population has been able to recover somewhat. The Ocelot is a strong and agile animal that can not only climb and run well but they are also good swimmers as they are not afraid of water like numerous other cat species. The Ocelot is an animal with short and thick, velvety fur that is usually tawny-yellow to reddish-grey in color and marked with black chain-like rosettes on its back and sides. There are dark spots on their legs and stripes on their head and face which are distinctive to the individual. They have a long tail that is generally marked with dark rings and large paws in relation to their body size. Like all feline species (with the exception of Cheetahs) the Ocelot can retract its claws into protective pockets that prevent them from becoming blunt whilst the Ocelot is walking about. Males tend to be substantially larger than females and can grow up to a meter in length with a tail half their body size on top of that. The Ocelot has sharply pointed front teeth which are used for biting down on its prey and blade-like teeth in each cheek that are used for tearing up food. The Ocelot is found throughout the South American tropics but is most common in the dense jungles of the Amazon Basin. They are, however, fairly widespread and inhabit a variety of different habitats from southern Texas to northern Argentina. The Ocelot is an incredibly adaptable animal that can be found in a variety of habitats including tropical forests, grasslands, mangrove forests, and marshes providing that there is plenty of dense vegetation. Although the Ocelot is usually found below 1,200 meters above sea level, they are also known to inhabit the high slopes of the Andes Mountains and have been found at heights up to 3,800 meters. As strong swimmers, they are also sometimes found in seasonally flooded forests and have been reported as living close to Human settlements. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The Ocelot is a solitary animal that occupies a home range that can be up to 30 square kilometers depending on the surrounding environment. Males tend to patrol territories that are often double the size of the females’, and that overlap the home ranges of a number of females (with which the male has breeding rights). The Ocelot is a nocturnal animal that spends its days sleeping either in thick vegetation or on a high and leafy branch. They have excellent sight, touch, and hearing which all help them when hunting at night, and they communicate with one another using soft meows which turn into loud yowls when looking for a mate. The Ocelot is an incredibly secretive animal that is very rare in some parts of its natural range and one that relies heavily on dense vegetation, only venturing into open areas during the night.

In the heart of the tropics, Ocelots are known to breed all year round but at the most northern and southern ends of its natural range, the breeding season tends to occur towards the end of the summer. After mating, the female Ocelot will find a crevice in the rocks, a hollow tree, or will nest in a dense and thorny thicket in order for her to have some privacy and protection whilst she is preparing to give birth. After about 85 days in the womb, the female Ocelot will give birth to up to 3 kittens, which are born without the ability to see and have a thin, dark coat of fur as opposed to their recognizable stripes and spots. Within about one month, the Ocelot kittens will be able to see their surroundings and their fur will have become thicker and more vibrant. Although Ocelot kittens are fully grown by the time they are a year old and are capable of becoming independent, they will often be tolerated in their mother’s home range for a couple of years before they leave to establish a territory of their own. The Ocelot is a carnivore, meaning they that hunt for food under the shade of night and they do so by stalking their prey primarily on the forest floor from the safety of dense foliage. Although small rodents make up a large portion of their diet, they are known to hunt a variety of small animals including rabbits, birds, fish, crabs, lizards and snakes, and will even hunt small deer on occasion. The Ocelot is also known to eat monkeys , turtles, armadillos, and anteaters. Ocelots have been known to cause problems by killing domestic birds when their typical food sources are unavailable. However, the Ocelot happily preys upon numerous different invasive species, so they are nevertheless a vital part of their local ecosystems and their diverse taste also helps them to more easily adapt to changing habitats. Not only is the Ocelot an important predator in its environment but they are also preyed upon by a number of large carnivores. Other felines including Jaguars and Pumas prey on the smaller Ocelot, along with Birds of Prey such as the Harpy Eagle and the world’s biggest snake, the Anaconda. The unique and distinctive fur of the Ocelot though actually provides it with some camouflage in the dense vegetation surrounding it but it is also this fur that has led to enormous population declines throughout much of its historical range. Hunted for their fur (known as pelts) particularly from the 1960s to the 1980s, the Ocelot nearly became extinct in the wild along with the fact that they were also captured and kept as exotic pets. Since the Ocelot became a protected species though in many countries, numbers have risen but they are now threatened by deforestation of their habitats. In a similar way to many other species of smaller wildcats, the Ocelot has been kept as a pet by many people throughout history. The most famous of these was the abstract artist Salvador Dali who was known to travel frequently with his domesticated Ocelot. It was even thought that Mr. Dali actually took his pet Ocelot on an ocean liner! The Ocelot is also thought to have been worshipped by ancient Peruvian cultures (in a similar way to the Ancient Egyptians worshipping cats), and these cultures would often depict the beautiful Ocelot in their artwork. The Ocelot is thought to be active for at least 12 hours a day and can travel distances of up to seven miles in that time, with males generally covering twice the distance of their female counterparts. The Ocelot was seen as a sacred animal by ancient cultures but its beautifully patterned and soft fur quickly attracted the attention of hunters. Ocelot population numbers were severely depleted throughout their natural range particularly during the 1960s and 1970s when they were thought to be so extensively hunted, that up to 200,000 skins were being traded each year and were selling for around 40,000 US dollars. Despite being wild and dominant predators, the Ocelot has also been captured to sell into the exotic pet trade which fortunately ceased after the Ocelot was listed on the Endangered Species List. Despite the fact that the Ocelot is now protected in most countries throughout its natural range and numbers have increased, populations particularly in certain areas are being severely affected by growing Human activity, primarily from deforestation and growing settlements. Today, the Ocelot is listed by the IUCN as being a species that is of Least Concern of becoming extinct in their natural environment in the near future. Although some populations are small and unstable, the Ocelot is widespread but the general population trend is now decreasing. This is mainly due to habitat loss as vast areas particularity in the Amazon, are subject to drastic deforestation and no longer provide the dense cover and adequate food supply that the Ocelot needs to survive. Taxonomists initially believed ocelots to be divided into up to 9 different subspecies. These included: But today only the Leopardus pardalis pardalis and Leopardus pardalis mitis are generally recognized as distinct subgroups of ocelots, the former being critically endangered and native to Arizona and Mexico, while the latter is much more populous and inhabits much of South America and some islands of the Caribbean."
