    "Name": "Bigfin Reef Squid",
    "Features": "Iridescent red and green colors that respond to light",
    "Text": "Also known as the glitter squid or oval squid, the bigfin reef squid belongs to the loliginid squid family Loliginidae. They get their name from the large oval fin connected to the mantle. Although they rank as a medium-sized species and only measure around 1.5 to 13 inches long, they grow faster than almost any other large marine invertebrate. They engage in elaborate mating displays and live relatively short lives, with a maximum age of just 315 days. The bigfin reef squid goes by many other names, including the oval squid, glitter squid, and green-eyed squid. In Australia, people sometimes refer to it as the northern calamari. Its genus name, Sepioteuthis, derives from the Greek words sepia, meaning “cuttlefish,” and teuthis, or “squid.” This name references the similarities in appearance between the bigfin reef squid and another cephalopod, the cuttlefish . Like other members of their genus, bigfin reef squids feature characteristic oval fins through the mantle that distinguishes them from other squids. These fins extend anywhere from 83% to 97% of the mantle lengths and up to 70% of the mantle width. Due to these fins, people often mistake them for cuttlefish. The mantle appears cylindrical and tapers to a cone at the end. At its longest, the mantle can measure up to 15 centimeters long, with males typically measuring larger than females. Males typically weigh between 0.9 and 3.1 pounds, while females weigh from 0.3 to 2.3 pounds. Bigfin reef squids possess large eyes and strong, curved beaks. They have 2 tentacles as well as 8 arms of varying lengths. The arms measure thickest near the body and taper to a narrow point. Each arm possesses two rows of suckers, with each sucker measuring less than 2 millimeters wide and sporting a ring of sharp teeth. Living bigfin reef squids range in color, including translucent white, pale yellow, and brownish pink. Chromatophores cover the top of the head, mantle, and arms but not the underside of the fins. These chromatophores allow bigfin reef squids to rapidly change body color and patterns in a process called metachrosis. Additionally, they possess iridophores in the head, which produce iridescent red and green lights when exposed to light. Depending on their age, bigfin reef squids exhibit both shoaling and schooling behavior. Juvenile squids often swim together in groups, although not parallel to each other like some schooling fish . Also, unlike some other squids, adult bigfin reef squids rarely cannibalize one other. This allows squids of different sizes to swim together without the threat of larger members attacking and eating the smaller ones. In the presence of light, bigfin squids display intense phototactic responses. They will move close to the light and then stop all other movements. This behavior does not vary based on the color of the light, but stronger lights appear to generate a more powerful response. You will most likely encounter bigfin reef squids in warm, shallow water. They commonly inhabit depths up to 328 feet below sea level. Their preferred habitats include regions near shorelines, rocky outcroppings, and coral reefs, hence their name. The juveniles often congregate under driftwood or other obstructions to avoid predators, particularly during the daytime. Bigfin reef squids are carnivorous predators that eat various marine life. They often hunt at night and retreat to deeper waters to hide during the day. Their diet consists primarily of prawns , crustaceans, and fish. They use their tentacles to grab and their 8 arms to hold onto their prey while they eat. Their strong, curved beaks are immensely powerful and perfectly suited for tearing flesh or breaking shells. While they can eat once every few hours, they also go up to 24 hours between eating meals. Several species prey on bigfin squids, including marlin, tuna , swordfish, sharks , whales, and groundfish. They are most vulnerable during their larval stage when their small size makes them especially susceptible to predators. Bigfin reef squids rely on their camouflage skills and ink sacs to avoid and escape from predators, respectively. They also have rather acute hearing compared to most cephalopods, which allows them to detect nearby predators. Although adult bigfin reef squids rarely cannibalize one another, cannibalism frequently occurs among juveniles. In addition to predators, bigfin reef squids also serve as hosts for several marine parasites such as Doricicola similis, Dicyema koshidae , and Dicyema orientale. Although bigfin reef squids often spawn in May, they can mate and lay eggs year-round. They typically engage in two different posturing behaviors. The first is called “accentuated gonads,” in which the squid draws attention to its sexual organs by making its mantle translucent while the gonads appear bright white. The second method is often used by the males and is called spread arms. This tactic involves the squid tilting its body forward and spreading its arms widely, and most often occurs when a male pursues a prospective female mate. When mating, bigfin reef squids employ several approaches, most of which last for only a few seconds. Sometimes, a male may swim rapidly back and forth beside a female before quickly depositing his spermatophores inside the female’s mouth funnel. Smaller males may also sneak up on females while they court a larger male in the hopes of successfully mating while the females are distracted. Other times, males and females may swim together side by side until the male directly deposits his spermatophore into the female’s mantle cavity at the opening of the oviduct. Female bigfin reef squids can lay anywhere from 20 to 1180 eggs throughout their lives. They can lay eggs year-round and die shortly after spawning. The eggs are often attached to rocks, corals, plants, or other underwater surfaces. After incubating for around 3 weeks, the larval squids emerge. They develop rapidly and can exhibit complex color-shifting behavior shortly after birth that doesn’t develop until much later in most other squid species. Males reach sexual maturity at around 140 days, while females sexually mature between 156 and 196 days old. The oldest bigfin reef squid ever recorded lived a total of 315 days, which represents a relatively short lifespan compared to other squids. Due to their rapid growth rate and abundance, bigfin reef squids are among the most commercially popular squid species. Every year, fishers harvest millions of bigfin squids from the ocean through trawling, seine fishing, and net traps. While most abundant during full moons and in foggy weather, their populations remain stable year-round. This likely has to do with the fact that they do not breed seasonally, so populations are constantly replaced. Despite their increasing importance as a food source, their worldwide population remains stable. As a result, bigfin reef squids have become the subject of much debate concerning their viability for mariculture. The bigfin reef squid is the most popular species in the genus Sepio teuthis. You can find them throughout the temperate and tropical waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Their native range extends from the Hawaiian Islands to the Red Sea and from Japan to Australia and New Zealand. In recent years, their range has expanded to include parts of the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea. Given their fast growth rate, fecundity, and widespread distribution, bigfin reef squids are extremely prolific. Their abundance makes them extremely important to commercial fishing operations, and they are a popular food source for many cultures worldwide. Even though fishers collect millions of bigfin reef squids each year, their population shows no signs of decline. Still, the IUCN lists the bigfin reef squid as a Data Deficient species, as not enough information exists at this time to determine its conservation status.",

    "Name": "Dwarf Boa",
    "Text": "Dwarf boas can be a fantastic option for those who want a snake, but not a behemoth. Boa species range from truly tiny to gargantuan, and some of the most beautiful species are gentle and calm, making them great pets – if you have the space. However, many of us don’t have enough space or the desire to have a buddy help us handle our 14-foot pet boa. Meet the dwarf boas. They can be of a naturally occurring smaller locality of Boa imperator , one of the Tropidophiidae dwarf boas, or a species that was bred to be smaller for owners who want the boa experience without the bulk. Boas, which are nonvenomous constrictor snakes, can be encountered in tropical regions of Central and South America. Similar to their anaconda relatives, they possess exceptional swimming abilities. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . However, they tend to favor terrestrial habitats and predominantly reside in hollow logs and deserted burrows previously occupied by mammals. The dwarf boa is a member of the Tropidophiidae family and inhabits the elevated cloud forests in northeastern Ecuador. This species stands out due to its possession of a “vestigial pelvis,” a feature commonly observed in primitive snakes. Some experts interpret this characteristic as evidence supporting the theory that snakes evolved from lizards that gradually lost their limbs over an extensive span of time. Those dwarf boas that were bred down in size are fairly easy to find from breeders. They tend towards the expensive end of the hobby, as they were specially bred for size, but they’re excellent choices for those who want a big snake that won’t get too big. Naturally occurring dwarf boas, such as those found in the Tarahumara region of Mexico, the Islands near Panama, and other areas. Some are being captive-bred in the U.S., so finding one of these for your next snake pet is possible without taking one from the wild. Often, these snakes live in areas where small sizes were rewarded by nature. It’s usually caused by limited prey and a lack of appropriate cover. The Boa look-alikes from the Tropidophis genus aren’t as readily available. Plus, given that many are endangered or threatened in nature, their focus should be on preserving those species. They also tend to be more delicate than their larger dwarf cousins. These snakes generally inhabit areas of South America and the West Indies; most species spend their day either hidden under vegetation or burrowed underground. They only surface at night and when it rains. A few arboreal species hide in the bromeliads that grow on trees. Dwarf boas aren’t one species of snake, they’re a class of boas and boa-like snakes that stay smaller than you expect from a boa. There are types of dwarf boas, we list a few here: This is what many people mean when they’re talking about dwarf boas. These are true boas that stay small because of the ecological niche that they inhabit in the wild. Corn Island boas, Caulkers Cay, Crawl Cay, Belize Mainland, and Hog Island boas are all subgroups of Boa Imperator . They aren’t generally considered subspecies, although some could possibly qualify. This species typically grows much larger – sometimes as long as 14 feet. However, because the prey is scarce, or the hiding spaces are small, only the small survive in their environment. Sometimes, when brought into a pet situation, a dwarf locality gets much bigger than expected. Why? Well, when you have a growing reptile that’s been accustomed to a particular amount of food, its body adjusts to that. It grows to fit its environment. Now, remove it from that environment and give it more food and better habitat. It’s going to get bigger than it would have in its native habitat, which makes the husbandry of these dwarf boas more challenging than that of other boas. These snakes happened to carry a dwarfism gene that a breeder decided to explore. They’ve become popular because they naturally stay much smaller than their “standard” cousins (and even some of the dwarf locality boas). These snakes typically only reach about 4-6 feet and look like a smaller version of the regular B. imperator or B. constrictor. At one point, this family was included in the Boidae family because they look like boas, but newer research indicated they are more closely related to false coral snakes than boas. So, out of the Boidae, and into Tropidophidiiae they went. There are two genera in this family and 19 species between them. They’re very secretive and difficult to observe. A few are in zoos but because they’re not as flashy as say, a rainbow boa or an anaconda these little guys just don’t get the public play that the true boas get. Many Tropidophis genus snakes have been assessed by IUCN and found to be Vulnerable or Endangered, but a few are classified as Least Concerns. One or two haven’t been seen in over 100 years and are assumed extinct. The highly secretive nature of the genus makes them exceedingly difficult to study. The dwarf boas bred deliberately by breeders aren’t out in nature, so there’s no assessment available. These snakes are strictly pet-trade animals, and that’s a beautiful thing – it allows snake lovers to have a boa in a small package and doesn’t deplete the wild population. The locality dwarfs, though – now there’s a good question. You could think of localities as nature’s version of a morph because they’re shaped by their environment. At this point, most locality boas have either been studied or are being studied and conservation is helping their population, like the Hog Island Boa. IUCN doesn’t list any of them as separate species from Boa constrictor , but some localities are endangered because of pet trade exportation and habitat destruction. There are a couple of locality dwarf boas from the Solomon Islands, they belong to the Candoia genus. These snakes are pretty stocky and spend a lot of time on the ground; they’re bred in captivity, but quite expensive when you find them. Because of the wide variety of dwarf boas both available as pets and out in the wild, the descriptions vary significantly. Even dwarf boas tend towards being heavy-bodied and muscular. However, due to their overall size, they’ll be a bit thinner than typical boa constrictors. Some species change color from night to day, becoming darker and lighter. These snakes are nonvenomous constrictors that grab prey with rear-pointing teeth and squeeze until the prey’s heart stops. Then, they swallow it whole. The Tropidophis genus dwarf boas are much more slender and fragile. Many of them change color depending on the time of day, and can even bleed voluntarily from the eyes, nostrils, and mouths when threatened. A dwarf boa isn’t as difficult or dangerous to handle as a full-size red-tailed boa because it’s small. Its teeth may make you bleed, but otherwise, you won’t suffer any ill effects from a bite. The wonderful part of any of the dwarf boa species is that they are small enough to handle relatively easily, they move slowly enough that you’re not going to be chasing it off across the yard, and they’re nonvenomous. Dwarf boas are relatively easy to handle. They’re not aggressive snakes, but some boas can be more prone to biting than other snake species. Like many animals, each snake has a different personality; they even have different moods. Dwarf locality boas from the Boa and Candoia genera make pretty good pets – if you are willing to take the time and money required to create a great habitat for them, proper feeding amounts, and learn to read their moods.",

    "Name": "Kokanee Salmon",
    "Features": "Reddish flesh",
    "Text": "The kokanee salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) is a non-anadromous type of sockeye salmon. Alternate names for this fish include kokanee trout, silver trout, Kennerly’s trout, Kennerly’s salmon, little redfish, kikanning, and Walla. Like other Pacific salmon, it only spawns once and then dies, limiting its lifespan to four or five years. It inhabits land-locked freshwater lakes in the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan. The scientific name for kokanee salmon is Oncorhynchus nerka . The name is a mixture of Greek and Russian. Oncorhynchus derives from the Greek terms for “nail” and “snout” while nerka is the Russian word for anadromous sockeye salmon. Kokanee salmon are a type of sockeye that are non-anadromous, or land-locked. Unlike this species, most sockeye are migratory, moving upriver from the ocean to spawn. Kokanee comes from the Sinixt word kekeni , an Indigenous term for the land-locked form of sockeye. The species belongs to the class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) within the superclass Osteichthyes (bony fishes). Scientists further place it in the order Salmoniformes and the family Salmonidae, which contains 11 genera and 66 species of salmon. Sockeye, including kokanee, belong to the genus Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmon and trout) . Prior to spawning, kokanee salmon have steel blue to bluish-green heads and backs, silver sides, and silvery-white bellies. Unlike most other salmon and trout, they do not have dark spots on their backs, though they may have speckles on their dorsal fins. During spawning, males develop a hump and a hooked jaw with teeth (a “kype”). They also turn bright red with dark green heads and black snouts and jaws. Females undergo a similar change, though their colors are duller. The color change is a result of a diet rich in carotenoids, which are pigments responsible for bright red, orange, and yellow coloration in animals and plants. The bright red attracts potential mates, but it also makes these fish more vulnerable to predators. These land-locked fish are typically smaller than anadromous sockeye. This is likely due to a less robust food supply in lakes and rivers as opposed to marine environments. While sockeye can grow up to 33 inches long and weigh as much as 17 pounds, kokanee salmon usually measure no more than 12-15 inches. They can weigh between three to five pounds, though most individuals don’t exceed one pound. However, the largest kokanee on record according to the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) measured 27 inches in length and weighed an impressive 9.67 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This species has fine scales that arrange themselves in rings, which (much like the rings of a tree) can help determine an individual’s age. It also has six types of fins with eight individual fins in total: a dorsal fin, an adipose fin, a caudal fin, an anal fin, two pelvic fins, and two pectoral fins. Kokanee salmon inhabit land-locked areas of the United States, Canada, Russia , and Japan. Within the United States, they occur in a number of states including Alaska , Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Idaho, New York, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, New England, North Carolina, and Utah. In Canada, they inhabit British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon Territory. These fish spend their whole lives in cool lakes, typically swimming at depths of 15-90 feet, though some go deeper than this. At spawning time, they move closer to the shore or upstream into tributaries. The IUCN has not assessed the conservation status of kokanee salmon as of 2022. As of 2010, it lists sockeye salmon as Least Concern due to its stable populations. However, NOAA Fisheries lists sockeye populations in Lake Ozette (Washington) and Snake River (Idaho) as protected under the Endangered Species Act. The WWF warns of potential threats to other Pacific salmon species including climate change, poaching, habitat destruction, river blockages, and overharvesting. You can find a list of endangered species here . The ancient ancestors of kokanee salmon lived as far back as 65-95 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period. During this time, they underwent a significant autotetraploid event in which they developed twice the number of chromosome arms and DNA content. Scientists speculate that this resulted in greater diversity and faster evolution. By the early Miocene Epoch, approximately 15-20 million years ago, two genera within Salmonidae split from each other. The first genus, Salmo , comprises Atlantic salmon ; the other, Oncorhynchus , contains Pacific salmon. Oncorhynchus speciated throughout the Miocene, producing all extant species by six million years ago. Although fossils of Pacific salmon from the ensuing Pleistocene are rare, scientists speculate that northwestern North America’s active geologic history inspired greater diversity among Oncorhynchus than Salmo . It is possible that kokanee salmon came from lake-type sockeye rather than sea-type sockeye. The lake-type may have become land-locked at some point and evolved into its current non-anadromous form. Taxonomists currently debate whether or not kokanee and sockeye salmon belong to two different species. Though they often inhabit the same habitats during spawning season, the two types do not automatically mate with each other. Interestingly, one study in Skaha Lake, British Columbia introduced a sockeye population to a kokanee population and observed the hybrid spawn. It discovered that 92% of hybrid individuals were non-anadromous with 76% being the offspring of resident non-anadromous females. Some sockeye offspring have been known to become non-anadromous while some kokanee offspring have become anadromous. A unique subtype of kokanee, black kokanee , exists in Lake Saiko in Japan and the Anderson and Seton lakes in British Columbia. Some scientists consider the Japanese type to be its own species, Oncorhynchus kawamurae . These isolated populations on either side of the Pacific exhibit black nuptial coloration and spawn much deeper than most sockeye salmon, anywhere between 65-230 feet below the surface. The lack of shared mtDNA haplotypes or a monophyletic grouping suggests that the Japanese populations likely split from the Anderson-Seton populations during two different evolutionary episodes. This may correspond to the multiple proposed postglacial splits of regular kokanee from sockeye. Kokanee salmon are omnivores, though they prefer animal matter to plant matter. Because of their small size, they are restricted to diminutive prey and are themselves easy targets for a number of predators. Kokanee salmon eat zooplankton, aquatic insects, freshwater shrimp, and small plants. Since zooplankton are so tiny, these fish use comb-like gill rakers on their gills to separate miniscule organisms from the water. Chinook salmon are the primary predators of kokanee salmon along with other large fish like rainbow trout, char, sturgeon , and burbot. They are also the targets of bears, wolves, otters, osprey and bald eagles , not to mention humans. The risk increases dramatically during spawning season when both males and females turn a conspicuous red. Unlike sockeye, kokanee salmon do not migrate from the rivers of their birth to the ocean. Instead, they move to nearby lakes, where they spend four to five years growing and maturing. After this, they reach sexual maturity and are ready to spawn either in the lake shallows or upstream in tributaries. Like all Pacific salmon, they are semelparous, dying soon after spawning. Because of their mating habits, these fish live only four to five years. Typically in their fourth year, males and females make their way to the site of their birth during a period of time called a “run.” Runs occur between August and December depending on the location. The female digs a trench, or a “redd.” Other, subordinate males may be in attendance, though the dominant male will fight them off using his kype and hump. The female may also be aggressive toward them as well as other females. Once ready, the female and dominant male descend together into the redd. They gape and vibrate until they release eggs and milt (sperm). One female typically lays approximately 1,000 eggs, though she may lay more or less depending on the availability of food sources. The other males may also release their milt on her other side. The female covers the fertilized eggs as she digs a new redd just upstream in preparation to spawn again. Both males and females may mate with multiple partners. The eggs incubate for approximately 110 days, usually hatching in February or March. Newly-hatched alevins depend on attached egg-yolk sacs for nutrition for the first two to three weeks of life. Once they develop into fry and then juveniles, they move downstream to a nearby lake or into deeper waters to feed and grow. Kokanee salmon are popular recreational or sport fish, though other sockeye salmon are important to commercial fisheries. NOAA estimates the 2021 worldwide commercial catch for sockeye salmon at 272 million pounds with a total value of $459 million. The vast majority of sockeye comes from Alaska, though fisheries net smaller numbers off the West Coast, mainly around Washington and Oregon. Though they are great for canning, these fish are also good fresh or frozen. For this species, fisheries typically use gillnet purse seines or reef nets. Though kokanee salmon are small, they are aggressive and fight hard to free themselves, making them valuable to recreational and sport anglers. These fish travel in schools, making it possible to catch multiple fish in one session. They are active during the day but are likeliest to bite at dawn and dusk when the light is low. The best types of bait are pink maggots, dye-cured shrimp, or canned corn, though anglers should be careful not to overload their hooks. One or two pieces of bait per hook should be sufficient. Kokanee salmon flesh is soft, rich, and vibrantly red with a pleasant, relatively mild taste. Acceptable ways to cook kokanee salmon include grilling, roasting, frying, smoking, and baking. Check out this comprehensive guide to smoked kokanee or explore a number of methods for preparing this delectable fish. This recipe for herbed kokanee with roasted garlic and lemon butter is a great way to get started. This fish yields relatively lean meat much like that of sockeye flesh . Per 155 grams, it contains 261 calories, 39 grams of protein, and 10 grams of fat.",

    "Name": "Coopers Hawk",
    "Features": "Long tail and rounded wingtips",
    "Text": "“The Cooper’s hawk is the stealthy and agile aerial predator of the American woodlands.” Cooper’s hawk is a bird known by many different names throughout North America, including the chicken hawk, striker, and flying cross. It is a medium-sized hawk that is often identified by its proportionally large head, black-banded tail feathers, and hunting habits under the canopy of wooded or forested areas. Even expert observers can easily confuse the identification of these hawks with similar related American hawks like the sharp-shinned hawk and northern goshawk . They spend most of their time in the canopy of densely wooded areas where they use their remarkable agility to stalk and ambush elusive prey species. They mostly eat smaller birds, but can also prey on mammals and insects. Cooper’s hawk has many common or local names, including chicken or hen hawk, quail hawk, swift hawk, big blue darter, striker, and flying cross. The species’ scientific name is Accipiter cooperii and they are members of the Accipitridae family in the Aves class. The name “Cooper” and “cooperii” are both derived from the original name given to the species by a French ornithologist who discovered it in 1828. He named it after the American naturalist William Cooper, his friend and contemporary, who also traversed the Americas to collect sample specimens of various animal species. The Cooper’s hawk is a bird with several key physical characteristics that are all adapted to increase their maneuverability, agility and stealth. They have relatively short wings compared to their size, with an average wingspan of about 33 inches. Their wings have distinctly rounded tips. They have very long tail feathers relative to wingspan and body size, which helps them precisely control their movements as they navigate around trees and make sharp mid-air turns to keep up with smaller, evasive birds. The hawk also has a relatively large head as well as a strong beak and talons that help it achieve a firm grip on its prey. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This medium-sized species ranges from 14 to 20 inches in total length, but this doesn’t stop them from targeting birds of comparable size. The average weight for a mature bird ranges from 1 to 1.5 pounds, with females being routinely larger than their male counterparts. In the United States, birds found nesting west of the Mississippi River is generally smaller than those east of the river. Body feathers range in color but are usually brownish or bluish-gray on the back and wings with a much lighter underbelly. Darker barring is usually seen across the underside. Unlike falcons and many of the more active raptor species, Cooper’s hawk is a patient and prudent predator that spends a lot of its time waiting in woodland canopies. They watch and listen for potential prey stealthily, relying on their camouflaged feathers to conceal them in the branches of trees. They prefer to ambush their prey and take them by surprise, but they are capable of remarkable burst speed to make a capture. However, they are usually unwilling to engage in lengthy pursuits and may break off the chase if their prey keeps distance for long enough. This species is an early riser and is more active in the dawn and morning hours than the afternoon. They also spend a substantial portion of their time preening on their roost to keep their feathers in perfect condition as they wait for prey. While they spend most of their time among the upper branches of trees, they sometimes take to the ground to hunt smaller mammals or take a drink from a secluded water source. Like many predatory birds, this hawk rarely makes a call or sound except as a warning against threats. Cooper’s hawks hunt almost exclusively in wooded areas with a tendency to stick to deciduous and mixed forests. They have a strong preference for temperate climates and their native range extends from southern portions of Canada through the entire continental United States to the northern portions of Central America. While they may remain in their local environment year-round, birds that live in Canada and the northern US tend to migrate south annually. Their smaller wings and long tail feathers are adaptations that help them navigate around trees and chase unpredictable prey. While they are capable of short bursts of speed, their body isn’t suited for diving or long pursuits like those of many other raptor species. Their dark and barred coloration also provides effective camouflage among the branches and treetops where they spend much of their time. Cooper’s hawk is an opportunistic carnivore that targets live prey and has a decent range of possible targets. Reported cases of these hawks consuming carrion are extremely rare. They have a definite preference for certain types of bird species as prey, but their diet can become flexible when the need arises. With common names like the hen hawk, quail hawk, and chicken hawk, Cooper’s hawk has an obvious preference for eating chickens, quail, and other plump fowl. They have long been a scourge of farmers, especially in centuries past, who had to worry about these hawks targeting their coops. Bats are another likely prey candidate for this hawk, as are most small to mid-sized bird species. Snakes , frogs , and various land mammals, including squirrels and chipmunks , may also fall prey to hungry hawks. This hawk is generally near the top of the food chain in its local environment, with potential predators limited to eagles and other larger birds. One of the biggest historical threats to the Cooper’s hawk was the widespread use of pesticides. These toxic agents infiltrated the food chain and reached high concentrations for hawks, falcons , and other predatory animals. Limitations in the use of these pesticides have allowed for some rebound and they are considered a species of least concern in terms of conservation. The species is not a source of food for humans, but they were once considered a fair target for shooting by people who wanted to protect their domesticated animals and local game birds. This practice was popular in the first half of the 20th century but was curtailed when the dwindling hawk population prompted conservation laws protecting them. Even though active shooting is now a minimal concern, these hawks are still sometimes hunted or poisoned to defend poultry or fowl. Even though their overall population is relatively stable, the Cooper’s hawk currently faces the ongoing threat of habitat loss. Logging activities and general encroachment by human development are slowly limiting their local ranges and forcing them into lower-quality environments. They have adapted to urban and suburban habitats with some success, but researchers are unsure of the long-term consequences or viability of this transition. These hawks tend to have only one mate per season, like most predatory birds, but this isn’t always the case. Mature adults also tend to select prospective mates of comparable size and pairings of larger individuals typically lay their eggs a bit earlier in the year than smaller birds. Courtship rituals are flexible and may involve just the male, just the female, or both at the same time. Mutual sky circling is a common occurrence alongside sky dances that may include arching, flaring, and other displays. Breeding and nest building usually takes place between February and March . In most cases, both members of the pair remain with the nest to gather food and defend their young. The nests are generally bulky structures made from sticks, bark, and assorted greenery. Hawks defending the nest may make a “kek” call to warn their partner when they feel threatened by a potential predator. Females generally lay 3 to 5 eggs that have a bluish-white shell. Both genders participate in incubating the eggs for about 35 days before they hatch. The chicks remain in the nest for 4 to 5 weeks before they start learning to fly. Wild birds have a life expectancy of 8 to 10 years, with the highest risk of mortality in the first year. The oldest known specimen tracked by banding reached an age of 20 years and 5 months. Despite intense persecution by humans and population reduction from pesticide exposure in the 20th century, the Cooper’s hawk has made a strong comeback. Their numbers are now estimated to be between 100,000 and 1 million across their entire native range and conservationists believe this number is currently stable. However, the continued destruction of habitat and threats to the population of desirable prey species could cause problems for them in the years ahead.",

    "Name": "Anole Lizard",
    "Features": "On most species, the brightly colored dewlap on the neck of the males",
    "Text": "The name Anole Lizard refers to one of over 400 species of mostly color-changing lizards located primarily in South and Central America. One of the most charming residents of the North American garden is the little green anole lizard. Curious and occasionally friendly, these bright green reptiles can be seen darting across deck rails and rearing their heads above flower pots. They hunt for moths among begonias and take flies for a snack with lightning-quick precision. There is a single species, the Green Anole, Anolis carolinensis , native to North America , which is sometimes called the American Chameleon. Though many anole lizards can exhibit color adaptations to their environment, the anole lizard differs from true Chameleons in many ways, not least in their very limited ability for color change. In most species, the male and female differ, most commonly because the males have a brightly colored dewlap on the necks, but males and females may also be characterized by size and sometimes nose length. Another species, the Brown Anole ( A. sagrei ), can be found in parts of the United States , but is considered an invasive species and has a negative effect on local ecosystems. A few other species, including the Knight Anole ( A. equestris ) are also found in Florida but are introduced species and not native to the area. Anoles come from the family Dactyloidae under the Class Reptilia. Because there are over 400 species, it would be impossible to list all their scientific names here. Collectively, they are called Anolis. Some of the subspecies are: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The size and color of each anole lizard species will differ depending on habitat, climate, and diet. Depending on where they live and how they hunt, they may have physical adaptations such as large hind legs for jumping large distances for prey, or short stubby legs if they live higher up in trees and creep up slowly on prey to avoid detection by their predators when hunting. They come in many colors, though the most common colors are a range of greens and browns, with yellow and sometimes blue variations. Most male anole lizards have a dewlap, which is a piece of erectile tissue on the neck, which can be collapsed and extended into a semi-oval shape. The dewlaps of the male can be almost any color, and usually, the color differs greatly from the lizard’s body. Anoles are mostly solitary. They may live near each other but are not generally found in groups. Males aggressively defend their territory during sexual maturity, otherwise, they are typically docile and tolerate humans to varying degrees. Various behavioral adaptations occur depending on the environment in which they live. Ancestors of the green anole lizard hail from Cuba, and long ago spread across the southeastern United States. These little green lizards are now sold in pet stores and have recently become the subjects of several evolutionary scientific studies. The evolution of animal species is often portrayed as a process that takes place over thousands of years – and that is often the case. But sometimes, as they say, needs must. The North American green anole offers an example of evolution at warp speed. It was a case of evolve or die. The green anole lizard is the only anole species native to the United States, and for most of their history, they have lived on or around the base of trees where insects abound. Someone brought brown anoles into the country in the 1950s, and those highly invasive lizards quickly began to drive the green anoles from the forest floor to higher branches. Rather than die out, the green anoles forged a new life in the trees and on higher ground. They became expert climbers and found new places to hunt. Amazingly, over a span of a mere 20 generations and 15 years, the green anoles evolved larger toe pads covered with more sticky scales to make climbing easier. According to scientists, this is a perfect example of “character displacement,” an evolutionary process that allows two closely related species to diverge and take advantage of separate niches. Other studies have proven that the resilient little lizards have evolved to tolerate colder temperatures after surviving extreme cold snaps in some states – while city anoles evolved stickier feet to make climbing up buildings easier. As a species, green anoles have learned to go with the flow to survive. Most anole lizard species live in or near trees, though some live near the base and some prefer the smaller limbs near the top. Their hunting styles will differ depending on their locations. Anole lizards may be found in bushes, reeds, low limbs, tree trunks, and forest canopies. They are found in many ecosystems, including on farms, in residential yards, in rainforests, dry forests, arid scrub, grasslands, and in riverside vegetation. Almost all anoles are insectivores, though some will also consume some vegetation and nectar. Anoles are hunters who feed primarily on insects , spiders, and other invertebrates , but may also consume nectar, tree sap, and occasionally rotted fruit. Larger species may consume smaller or baby lizards, snakes , and eggs. One threat to anoles is other anoles. For instance, when they share a habitat, Brown Anoles will eat Green Anoles and their eggs. They are also prey for larger reptiles and snakes, as well as many predatory birds and a few small mammals . Their color-changing abilities afford them some protection from predators, but they are vulnerable during mating when they increase their movements and show off brighter colors. Typically, when males reach sexual maturity, they will hunt for a mate by flexing their dewlap and sometimes doing what looks like push-ups. These pushups are also used as a show of strength to discourage other males from entering the mating territory. Both males and females are polyamorous, mating with multiple partners over their lifespans. Male anoles defend a singular territory so that they can have exclusive access to females that enter into or live within that territory. However, the females wander outside the territories and mate with other males also. When a mate is found, the female will lay one or two eggs after copulation, often every day through the mating season. A baby will hatch at about 0.75 inches in size. A baby anole will reach sexual maturity at about 18 months and have a lifespan of two (wild) to seven years (captive). Populations vary widely between species with Green Anoles being estimated at around 100,000 specimens or more and the Blue Anole so rare that it may be headed for extinction.",

    "Name": "Rock Bass",
    "Features": "Black dots on their gill plates",
    "Text": "The rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) also known as the black or rock perch , is a type of freshwater fish that belongs to the sunfish family. It’s a medium-sized fish native to the lakes and ponds in North America, popular with anglers for fishing purposes. They are generally smaller than smallmouth bass and have a distinctive appearance, making them distinguishable amongst other popular angler fish. Rock bass belongs to the Centrarchidae family in the Ambloplites genus. The binomial or scientific name for rock bass is Ambloplites rupestris . Rock bass is easy to identify when you know what to look for. These fish have a characteristically large mouth set underneath their eyes, which are a deep red coloration. These fish are not very large compared to other types of bass, only growing around 6-10 inches in length. They can weigh up to 3 pounds, but one pound is common in smaller specimens. Their color is quite interesting, and these fish have predominantly yellowish-brown bodies with silver and black. Shades of black are seen throughout the tips of their anal fins, and black dotted striped line their body horizontally. A black dot is located near the fish’s gill plates. The dorsal fin is spiny and lacks a uniform shape. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Even though rock bass is part of the sunfish family, they do not have a flat body. Their body has a less compressed body that looks similar to a bluegill and largemouth bass. It is not uncommon for this fish to be misidentified as warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), but instead of having three spines on their anal fin, rock bass has around six instead. This fish relies on their body coloration for camouflage purposes, which enables them to change its color to black or silver to match its environment. This can make it difficult to identify them if they are changing their color. This type of camouflage helps to protect them from predators, but it can also change with age and stress. Rock bass is native to east-central North America, but they have been introduced into Atlantic river drainages. They are distributed throughout southeastern Canada from Ontario to Quebec, toward the Mississippi River Basin, and all the way to Missouri and Arkansas. This fish is plentiful in most parts of the Dakota river in the U.S. and the Great Lakes region along with Torch and Champlain lake. They have also entered the Savannah River basin and eastern parts of the U.S., such as New York, Tennessee, and Kentucky. You can also find rock bass in the southern parts of Florida, Alabama, and parts of Georgia in the Chattahoochee River basin. The population of rock bass is considered the “least concern” on the IUCN red list. They are not considered an invasive species. Fishing for rock bass as a sport is managed by some rules and regulations, and artificial water systems are used to manage and maintain populations of rock bass. This is a freshwater fish that inhabit various bodies of water. This includes lakes, river systems, reservoirs, shore banks, ponds, weed beds, streams, and spring holes. These fish prefer cooler waters with plenty of rocks, hence their name “rock bass.” The water should ideally be rich in vegetation and covered with a rocky bottom. The water should ideally have low turbidity, so rocks, wooden branches, and vegetation should be plentiful as hiding places. The bottom of the water system should be filled with rocks or sand. These fish do not typically inhabit waters with silt. Their ideal current is slow-moving, and they avoid river areas with fast-moving currents. The main predators of young rock bass include northern pike, larger bass species, muskies, and walleye. Adult rock bass is generally more protected when they have a larger size. They are carnivorous fish that prey on smaller fish. In some cases, they may eat their own fry if there is insufficient vegetation and rocks to keep the fry safe. The main times that adults can be seen preying on food items are during the early mornings and evenings, and they are diurnal. They will eat a variety of smaller fish, including minnows, amphibians, zooplankton, and yellow merch, along with small crustaceans and insects and their larvae. They will also readily eat a variety of baitfish from the surface. The average lifespan for rock bass is between 8-10 years in the wild. Certain specimens can live longer, but it is uncommon for rock bass to live for more than 12 years. They can reproduce once sexually mature at 2-3 years old. They are polyandrous, which means that they mate with multiple fish during the spawning season. Females can lay more than 5,000 eggs during a single spawn, which occurs around April till the beginning of June in warmer water. Spawning occurs around rock bass nests, typically created close to each other. Males are responsible for building the nest, and they can become quite territorial during this time in efforts to protect the nest. Once spawning has occurred, the male will fan the eggs and protect the fry shortly after hatching. Not all fry enter adulthood, as rock bass sometimes eat their young or are eaten by predators. Rock bass is considered to be game fish, and they are popular for fishing. This fish enjoys a variety of bait such as wax worms, nightcrawlers, minnows, and other types of baitfish. The best way to catch one is to use artificial lures or live bait. A micro fishing rod and a fishing reel with a smooth drag are a good choice for catching them. These fish do not spend much time in the middle of the lake and prefer to school around the bank or shoreline of the water in vegetation and structures where they feel secure. They can be used in cooking, and they are edible. These fish can be pan-fried or baked, but ensuring the internal temperature is right before consumption is important. The flesh of the bass is described as flaky and white.",

    "Name": "Golden Tortoise Beetle",
    "Features": "Metallic gold elytra",
    "Text": "The golden tortoise beetle is a species of insect in the leaf beetle family, known for its striking gold color. They have rounded, domed bodies, similar to that of ladybugs . This beetle has a unique ability to change the shade of its pigmentation from bright to dull gold using microscopic cavities in its cuticle. When threatened, the beetle presses its body close to the leaf surface, then tucks its appendages underneath its body like a tortoise . Golden tortoise beetles are herbivores, feeding on plants in the Convolvulaceae family. The golden tortoise beetle is an insect species in the leaf beetle family (Chrysomelidae). This group consists of more than 37,000 species of fully herbivorous beetles grouped into 2500 genera. This makes them one of the most commonly encountered beetles. This beetle is sometimes referred to as goldbug. The golden tortoise beetle species – Charidotella sexpunctata – contains one subspecies, Charidotella bicolor . Both are considered golden tortoise beetles. They’re native to the Americas and are mostly found in the United States , Canada , and Mexico . The goldbug is one of the few bugs in the world with a fully gold-colored body. They belong to a subfamily of insects known as tortoise beetles. This group of beetles is characterized by a wing covering (elytra) that extends to the side of their body, long enough to cover their legs, hence the name tortoise beetle. Goldbugs have round and domed bodies. They are similar to lady beetles in shape and size. Of course, they differ significantly from ladybugs in color and behavior. Like other tortoise beetles, adult golden beetles are characterized by expanded elytra that cover their head and appendages. The margins of the extended wing cover are not golden like the rest of their body. Instead, it is transparent and has a glass-like appearance. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These beetles are fairly small. They typically measure between 5 to 7 millimeters in length. Their most distinctive feature is their shiny, metallic gold color which earned them their common name and nickname, goldbug. Although they’re known for their bright golden color, golden tortoise beetles don’t always maintain this color. Their color changes as they grow, when they’re mating, or when they’re disturbed. Scientists are not certain of the mechanisms for this color change, but it is believed to be due to changes in the microscopic particles on their cuticles. Some theories also suggest that the color change is due to their ability to withdraw or introduce moisture to the surface of their exoskeleton. They can dull their bright metallic sheen, turning the lovely gold color to a brown or reddish brown. When the insect dies, the metallic gold color fades. The golden tortoise beetle is native to the Americas. They mostly live in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In places they live, they’re mostly found in association with plants in the family Convolvulaceae, their primary host. Adults emerge during the winter, but the beetles usually move to the host plant around spring. The field bindweed ( Convolvulus arvensis ) is typically their early season host. Later, they move to other plants, like the sweet potato and morning glories. Mostly found in fields and gardens, goldbugs rarely venture indoors. Many gardeners prefer to keep them around because of their striking appearance. Like all leaf beetles, golden tortoise beetles are fully herbivorous. They’re one of several tortoise beetles that feed on garden vines. Both adult and larvae forms of this insect feed on plants, leaving unsightly holes on the leaf surface. Plants in the Convolvulaceae family are their only food source. This includes morning glories, bindweed, and sweet potatoes. They do not form large swarms, and the damage they leave behind is mild. Most plants recover fully. Parasitic wasps of the genus Tetrastichus and the parasitoid fly, Eucelatoriopsis dimmocki , prey on goldbugs. Several ladybug species also prey on the larvae of this beetle. Damsel bugs, assassin bugs , shield bugs, and other insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts may prey on the larvae of golden tortoise beetles. Although the larvae carry a shield made from waste products and dead skin to deter prey, it is only effective against small predators. Golden tortoise beetles don’t occur as major infestations. Hence, they’re hardly a concern for gardeners; however, if you prefer to keep them away, you should keep your garden free from weeds and make sure you care for your plants properly. This will help prevent various pests, including goldbugs. Since they’re quite conspicuous, you can remove the beetles by hand. This is the easiest way to handle small infestations. You can also mix an organic spray using two tablespoons of neem oil , one tablespoon of dish soap, and a gallon of water. Spray this on your plants to get rid of small clusters of the beetles. Goldbugs have a lot of natural enemies. These include aldrich flies, burks, and several species of ladybugs, such as damsel bugs and assassin bugs. You can release them into your garden to get rid of the larvae of this beetle. Chemical insecticides should only be a final resort, if any of the organic control measures don’t work.",

    "Name": "Chameleon",
    "Text": "The chameleon, scientific name Chamaeleonidae, is a species of lizard known for their ability to change colors and degrees of brightness. There are over 160 species of chameleon spread across Madagascar, Spain, Africa, Asia, and Portugal. They have large eyes and curled tails, and some species can change the color of their skin to blend in with their surroundings as a defense mechanism from predators. These lizards can change their skin to pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, and turquoise. The scientific name for a chameleon is Chamaeleo, which is derived from the Greek word “chamai” meaning on the ground and “leōn” meaning lion. This genus of lizards contains over 160 species that are native to Africa, Madagascar, Southern Europe, and Asia. They are known for their ability to change colors with their environment, allowing them to blend in perfectly with trees or rocks. Furthermore, they can also move each eye independently of one another to have a larger field of vision. A chameleon is an incredible animal with a unique ability to change its colors and blend into its environment. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors depending on the species. Generally speaking, most chameleons have flattened bodies and long tails with five digits on each foot that are adapted for gripping branches or other surfaces. Their eyes can move independently of one another which helps them scan their surroundings more efficiently. Chameleons also possess a protruding tongue which they use to capture prey such as insects or small lizards. On average, they range in size from 2 inches up to 24 inches in length! Depending on the species, they usually feature bright hues of green and yellow with various patterns of spots throughout their body making them quite eye-catching reptiles! See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Chameleons are animals that are found throughout the jungle and desert alike, in Africa, Asia, and parts of Southern Europe , and chameleons have also been introduced to parts of North America. Most of these lizards live in trees or in bushes. Only a few species of chameleon live on the ground under piles of leaves. There are many animals that eat these lizards. In fact, the smaller a chameleon is, the more likely it is to be eaten by a larger animal. Some of the predators include snakes, birds, and sometimes monkeys . Though they can blend in with their environment, they are near the bottom of the food chain. This means there are many animals above them on the food chain that can eat them. A chameleon’s ability to change color to match its environment is its way of protecting itself when a predator is nearby. If this lizard is on a branch, its skin can turn a color that is very close to the color of the branch. Many predators may pass by without ever seeing the chameleon sitting quietly on the tree branch. The chameleon is a very unique species of lizard, known for its ability to change color in order to adapt to their environment. It has been around for millions of years and is believed to have descended from the iguanid family. Chameleons are found throughout Africa, Madagascar, parts of southern Europe and Asia, as well as some islands in the Indian Ocean. The evolution of the chameleon has also enabled it to develop several interesting characteristics that make it uniquely suited to its habitat. They have specialized eyes with 360-degree vision which allows them to see predators from any direction, long tongues so they can catch prey quickly, prehensile tails which help them climb trees more easily, and claws that enable them to grip branches firmly. Additionally, their skin pigmentation allows them to blend into their surroundings almost instantly when threatened by a predator or other animals. Overall, the incredible evolutionary process behind the chameleon’s remarkable adaptation capabilities is truly amazing! Chameleons are known for their ability to change color, but they also possess many other interesting behaviors. Chameleons are known to be solitary creatures, spending most of their time alone or in pairs. They can often be seen basking in the sun on branches or leaves, and when disturbed they will normally take cover among the foliage. Their long tongues help them catch prey such as insects and small reptiles; they have excellent vision which helps them spot potential food sources from a distance. When threatened by predators, chameleons may puff themselves up to appear larger than normal and give off a hissing sound as a warning sign. In addition to this defensive behavior, some species of chameleon may even fight each other using their tails! Chameleons are animals that communicate with one another by using their body language. For instance, a chameleon trying to protect its territory from an intruder is likely to turn sideways. This makes the lizard look bigger and more threatening. A chameleon that feels threatened may open its mouth to try to scare another one away. Most species of these lizards lay eggs, while a few have live babies. The female digs a hole in the ground and lays her eggs inside it to keep them warm. Usually, they lay around 20 eggs, but it can be more or fewer depending on the species. It can take four months to a year for the eggs to hatch. Jackson’s chameleon is one example of a species that have live babies. This lizard can have from 8 to 30 live babies after being pregnant for about six months. Chameleons, like most other reptiles, reproduce sexually. During courtship and mating rituals, male chameleons will display their bright colors to attract mates. Male chameleons also use head bobbing as a way of flirting and competing with rivals for the attention of females. If a male is successful in both displaying his colors and winning the battle using body language instead of physical contact, he may be chosen by the female for mating purposes. The gestation period for chameleon eggs ranges anywhere from one month to several months depending on species and environmental factors such as temperature or humidity levels. After hatching from eggs laid in nests underground or in trees or bushes, baby chameleons are born without parental care; they must fend for themselves after birth. The lifespan of a chameleon depends on its species but generally ranges from five to fifteen years when kept in captivity with optimal conditions such as proper diet and environment being met regularly. Wild-living chameleons tend to have shorter lifespans due to a lack of food sources, predators, disease exposure, etc., which can drastically reduce their life expectancy if not addressed properly. Chameleons eat a diet that’s mostly focused on insects . While chameleons are omnivores that will feed on vegetation such as dandelions and other vegetation, most of their prey is insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, and dragonflies. For a full list of chameleon diets, give our ‘ What Do Chameleons Eat? 16 Foods in their Diet ‘ page a read! Chameleons are fascinating creatures that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, their numbers have been steadily declining due to a number of factors, including habitat destruction and hunting for the pet trade. As a result, several species of chameleon have been listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. For example, Parson’s Chameleon is classified as Endangered due to its restricted range and continued decline in population size from ongoing habitat loss, poaching for pets, and over-collection by scientists. Another species at risk is the Panther Chameleon which has seen significant declines in Madagascar due to deforestation activities such as burning woodlands for agriculture. Conservation efforts must focus on protecting suitable habitats so these amazing animals can continue to thrive around the world.",

    "Name": "Hogfish",
    "Text": "The Hogfish is a species of wrasse fish found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It has a distinctive pig-like snout and is known for its delicious taste and firm flesh, making it a popular choice for seafood lovers. This attractive fish can measure up to 24 pounds and reach a maximum length of 36 inches. It is also a popular sportfish, with anglers targeting them for their strong fighting ability and vibrant colors. However, not only are Hogfish found in shallow waters near coral reefs they also make beautiful-looking pets in saltwater aquariums. This species of fish belongs to the wrasse family known as Labridae. It is classified as a ray-finned fish called Actinopterygii. Therefore, giving its scientific name Lachnolaimus maximus. There are roughly 45 different varieties of Hogfish species, but the following are the most prevalent ones, namely: Hogfish have a distinctive appearance that makes them easily recognizable. They have a long, laterally compressed body that is similar in shape to snapper or grouper fish . Their body color varies from a reddish-pink to yellow color, with white and yellow fins. Its most notable feature is their large, protruding lower jaw, which gives them a characteristic “hog-like” appearance. Hogfish also have large, expressive eyes and a dorsal fin that runs the length of their body. They can grow up to 2 feet in length, with males being larger than females. Hogfish are known for their ability to change color, which they use to communicate with other Hogfish or to blend in with their surroundings. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These fish have a broad distribution ranging from North Carolina to the coast of Brazil, including the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Gulf of Mexico. The population of this fish species is considered stable due to fishing limitations and fishermen being monitored by the Wildlife Conservation Commission. All these regulations protect these unique fish from overfishing. Hogfish are bottom-dwelling fish found near coral reefs and deeper waters at depths of 10 to 100 feet. Because they don’t migrate, they typically stay in the exact location all year round. The term Lachnolaimus maximus is derived from the Greek words lachne meaning wool, and laimos meaning throat, referring to the hairy throat some species of wrasse possess. The specific epithet Maximus means most significant and refers to the fact that Hogfish is one of the largest species in the wrasse family. Originally found only in the Western Atlantic Oceans, Hogfish are now found all over the globe. Hogfish are preyed upon by a variety of larger fish and marine mammals. Their natural predators include larger predatory fish such as barracuda , groupers, and jacks, as well as marine mammals such as dolphins and seals. Juveniles are particularly vulnerable to predation and are often preyed upon by a variety of smaller fish and invertebrates. To avoid predation, they will often take refuge in crevices in the reef or bury themselves in the sand, using their ability to change color to blend in with their surroundings. In some cases, Hogfish may also form schools with other fish species for protection from predators. These predatory fish have been observed to consume a range of prey, such as shrimp, crabs, calamari, and other small fish. Hogfish search for food in coral and sand using their sharp, protruding lower jaw, where they go on a feeding spree. Hogfish have a variety of diets depending on their size and age. Still, they are usually considered opportunistic feeders who use any available food sources in their environment. Hogfish reproduce by external fertilization, and when they are ready to spawn, the males and females gather in big groups. During the breeding season, the male frequently establishes and protects a territory, luring females to deposit their eggs, which the male then fertilizes. The fertilized eggs grow into larvae that float on the ocean’s surface before maturing into adults by settling there. However, before developing into juvenile fish, this species is unique because all the spawned eggs are only born as females but can later transform into males. In addition, they can have a long lifespan of approximately 11 years. Due to its popularity as a game fish, commercial and recreational fishermen greatly value Hogfish. The most widely used method for catching this species is bottom fishing. Bottom fishing involves casting a line into the ocean’s floor while weighted and equipped with a hook and bait. Other methods include using a spear gun or chumming the water with a mixture of fish byproducts and capturing the fish using a net . In addition, these fishing techniques can be successful depending on the angler’s skill level and the water conditions. It is prized for its delicate, sweet taste and tender, flaky flesh, which make it a delicacy. There are numerous methods to prepare this fish which include grilling, sautéing, broiling, and baking. It should not be overcooked because the toughness of the flesh can result from doing so. Tacos, ceviche, and linguine are a few well-known ingredients that can be added to create a Hogfish dish. In addition, it’s important to cook your fish at an internal temperature of 145°F to eliminate any potential foodborne pathogens.",

    "Name": "Knight Anole",
    "Features": "Knight anoles are the largest of the anoles",
    "Text": "When threatened, the promiscuous knight anole rises on all fours, turns bright green, and gives a menacing look. Knight anoles are the largest anole species. An average anole can grow to be as long as 20 inches. The vertebrates were originally natives of Cuba but have been introduced to Florida. They are quite common and are bigger than the green and brown anoles most people in Florida are familiar with. Knight anoles are fiercely territorial. They are bold and tend to face any perceived threat rather than back down. The scientific name of the knight anole is Anolis equestris. It belongs to the genus Anolis, while the common name ‘equestris’ is a Latin word that means ‘mounted.’ It is also commonly called Cuban knight anole or Cuban giant anole in reference to its native country. In Cuba, the lizard is known by the native name “chupacocote.” It belongs to the Dactyloidae family. Anolis equestris belongs to a group of anoles called the equestrus species complex. They are grouped together because of the remarkable similarities in their appearance, behavior, and ecomorphs. The other species in the equestrus species complex are: The knight anole is the largest species of anole. It has a large, bony head that can be likened to the knight piece in chess, hence its name. This lizard can grow to a length of up to 20 inches, longer than the green and brown anoles. They typically weigh between 0.56 and 4.83 ounces. They are sexually dimorphic, with the male anoles tending to be larger than the female species. The snout-tail length for an average male is typically between 3.9 and 7.5 inches, while that of the female is around 3.5–6.3 inches. In both males and females, their tails are longer than their bodies bringing the total length of the lizard to about 13–20 inches. Although this lizard is primarily green, it can change its color to light brown depending on its mood and the environment. The color of the young anole is a lighter shade, and they often have color bands. The anole has several teeth which are small and sharp, with which they can deliver painful bites. Knight anoles are diurnal. A group of anoles is called a “lounge.” However, they are rarely found in groups because they’re mostly solitary and territorial. When a perceived threat approaches, the knight anole puts up an elaborate display. They sit high on their four limbs to create a menacing look. They also change color and bob their heads at the intruder. This lizard can also puff itself up while males extend their dewlap. Interestingly, They are less aggressive in captivity. But that’s not to say they’re completely docile. The knight anole does not like to be held and can deliver a painful bite. However, if they have been raised from birth, they can be gentle enough to be held by the people they’re familiar with. This lizard is native to Cuba and was introduced to Florida in 1957 . The introduction happened in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The eventual spread of this species to other counties in Florida has been speculated to be both natural and human-assisted. As a result, they are now widespread in the southern Florida region. Another speculation made about the cause of the spread is the possibility of their escape from careless owners in Florida, after which they begin to multiply rapidly. They are arboreal animals that live at altitudes ranging from near sea level to about 3,300 feet. Their natural habitat has many trees, and they spend a lot of time up the trees. Sometimes they move from one tree to the other or to the ground to thermoregulate. You may also find this lizard on rocks, asphalt, or sidewalks. In addition to forest habitats, the knight anole lives in mangroves, savannas, and cultivated gardens. The species is not built to withstand cold. It is a popular sight to see them freeze and fall to the ground from trees during winter in Florida. Although they’re largely solitary, you may find them huddled together for heat during cold seasons. Knight anoles are mostly carnivores. The diet of the young knight anole is mainly insects when they are still young. However, older anoles have a more varied diet, including invertebrates such as snails or even fruits. They may even eat vertebrates like small birds, frogs , and other reptiles (including other anoles). The invasive knight anoles can reproduce and multiply at a very fast rate. This makes them a threat to other species as they saturate and dominate limited space and resources. They are not near extinction since they can multiply quickly with minimal effort. Snakes and birds are their most common predators. Larger anoles may also prey on juveniles. Their population is currently not under threat. Anolis equestris is polygynandrous. This implies that the male and female anoles have more than one reproductive partner in one breeding season. The species are oviparous, and they reproduce during the summer. Their behavior during the mating season tends to be similar to how they behave when they feel threatened. The males frequently nod their heads. They also expand and contract their dewlaps as a sort of mating display. After mating, the female Cuban giant anole lays eggs about an inch in length after every 10 days. The young anoles hatch out of their eggs after 45 days. Juveniles look similar to adults but are smaller and more lightly colored. The hatchlings are usually 2-5 inches long. Young anoles are self-sufficient from birth, and adults don’t exhibit any parental care. The lifespan of the Cuban knight anole is a function of how well they are treated. They tend to live longer when they regularly feed on insects and bugs. They can live as long as 10 years in captivity with quality care. The current population trend of the knight anole is unknown. However, they have been assessed by the IUCN to be a Least Concern animal. This means that they do not currently face any population threat and are abundant in the wild They have extended beyond the shores of their native country (Cuba) and are now found across Florida, with a stable population.",

    "Name": "Keyhole Cichlid",
    "Text": "Native to South America, keyhole cichlids are freshwater fish that live in slow-moving bodies of water covered in thick vegetation. They are primarily found in coastal streams, tributaries, and river basins. Venezuela’s lower Orinoco basin is home to where many of the keyhole cichlids live. Scientifically known as Cleithracara maronii , the Keyhole cichlid belongs to the family Cichlidae . Their name originates from the distinctive keyhole pattern on their body. The most distinctive feature of this fish is the black keyhole mark on its upper flank. This secondary marking is located on the fish’s face, which displays a black vertical line that extends across the head and passes through the eye. Their body consists of yellow-cream colored scales; however, different keyhole fish species have different fin colors. Additionally, with age, keyhole cichlids’ coloring lightens. The dorsal and anal fins of keyhole cichlids are long and slender. They differ from other cichlid species by having rounded foreheads and oval-shaped bodies. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The species of this fish is found in Central and South America. It has a wide distribution, ranging from the Atlantic coast of Panama to the Amazon River basin in Brazil. It is a freshwater fish that inhabits slow-moving rivers, streams, and lakes. The population of the keyhole cichlid fish is considered stable; unfortunately, it’s threatened by habitat destruction and pollution. This fish species prefers to live in shallow, murky waters in areas with plenty of vegetation. It is a carnivore that feeds on insects, crustaceans , and small fish. In the wild, the keyhole cichlid predators include larger fish, such as the piranha and birds of prey. Other potential predators include snakes, caimans, and other aquatic animals. In addition, the keyhole cichlid is also preyed upon by other fish, such as the oscar and the discus. To protect itself against certain predators, the keyhole cichlid will hide in rocks and crevices and use its bright colors to blend in with its surroundings. These fish reproduce by laying eggs on a flat rock or a hard surface . The male is responsible for providing a suitable location so the female can lay her eggs. The female will lay up to 500 eggs, which the male guards until these eggs hatch. During this time, the male will fan the eggs with his fins to keep these eggs oxygenated and free of debris. The eggs will then hatch within a few days, and both parents will take care of the young fish (now called fry) until they can swim and look for food. After this stage, the male will no longer guard the fry, and the female will take over caring for them. The lifespan of the keyhole cichlid is usually between 5-10 years. However, they are a hardy species and can live longer with proper care. This sought-after fish is known to put up a good fight, so it is essential to use the correct tools and bait to catch these intelligent fish. The keyhole cichlid has a taste for white bread, worms, shrimp, and minnows ; use these ingredients as bait. And, of course, invest in a hardy spinning reel, as these fish come with great force. Fishing the keyhole cichlid is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and experience the thrill of the catch. This colorful fish is a popular choice for freshwater anglers and can be found in many parts of the world. As for cooking this tasty fish, it’s a great staple to a delicious meal. This fish is an excellent option for those looking for a unique flavor and texture. Not only is it a healthy choice, but it is also easy to prepare. With just a few simple ingredients such as prawns, spinach, peas, garlic, juice of an orange, and spirulina powder, you can create a flavorful dish that will be sure to please. If you are looking for something new and exciting, add this fish to your culinary repertoire. The population of this fish found in the wild is stable, as It is not considered to be threatened or endangered. Furthermore, this popular aquarium fish is a peaceful species well-suited to a community tank, making these fish a popular choice for aquarists.",

    "Name": "Oenpelli Python",
    "Text": "The Oenpelli python is a long, thin snake that reaches 16 feet and can change color. This species lives in a tiny region in Northern Territory, Australia. It is one of the rarest python species in the world. This species only lives in Northern Territory, Australia. It is most often found in the Arnhem Land and Kombalgie sandstone gorges. The Oenpelli python is nocturnal and spends most days in the shelter of tree hollows, caves, and rock crevices prevalent in its home range. It is an ambush predator, so it waits for most of its food to come to it. Like other snakes, it is opportunistic and will take a meal where it can get it; however, its preferred foods are small animals like birds, flying foxes, possums, and rock wallabies. Some believe that it specializes in hunting birds – it climbs well and sometimes preys on birds up in the trees . The Oenpelli python’s scientific name is up for debate. In 1977, when it was first described, scientists classified it as Python oenpelliensis. Then, more researchers studied the snake; they came up with a few other ideas. At various times, this snake has been included with the Morelia and Simalia genera, and as a solo animal species in either Nawaran or Nyctophilopython . At present, it appears that scientists favor Nyctophilophython oenpelliensis , but Morelia oenpelliensis is probably just as accurate. Scientific discussion aside, the snake’s specific name refers to the area where it lives, Oenpelli in Northern Territory, Australia. Some call it the Oenpelli rock python, and the traditional name given to it by the people of the Arnhem Land is Nawaran. The name Nyctophilopython means – “night-loving big snake.” It’s Greek and breaks down like this: Nycto- translates as night, philo- is love, and python means big snake. The Oenpelli python occurs in an area of approximately 1,240 square miles in the Northern Territory, Australia. This is the only place in the world where it lives, and its population and habitat are highly fragmented. Scientists estimate that less than 10,000 mature individuals remain in the wild in pockets within their native territory. The biggest problem the species has is that cats and other invasive species eat the small animals that the Oenpelli python prefers. So, without a steady source of food, fewer snakes are born, and fewer still make it to adulthood to breed. They live in a remote, isolated region of Australia. As a result, we don’t have a lot of information about its population, rate of decline, or how many actually live there. The estimate of fewer than 10,000 mature individuals isn’t based on observation. Rather, it’s inferred based on environmental factors such as the numbers of their preferred prey and their population in the region. It’s also illegally collected for the pet trade, but no one knows how common this is, nor how much it affects the Oenpelli python population. In 2012, biologists brought several into captivity in order to breed them. The agreement is that after the captive population reaches a certain point, they will begin releasing them into the wild, thereby having a backup – just in case the wild population needs help. This is one of the exceptions to the idea that pythons are big, bulky snakes. It’s long and thin and may reach 16 feet long as an adult. The Oenpelli python has a triangular-shaped head and elliptical pupils and eyes that seem a bit large for its head. Its body is pale brownish to olive in color, with rows of large dark blotches down the length of its body. This snake has smooth scales, and it has over 400 belly or ventral scales – the only python species to have so many. Oenpelli pythons have iridescent scales, and the Bininj Aboriginal people have historically viewed it as a totemic animal. This snake also changes color – lighter during the day and darker at night. It also seems to lay large eggs – really big in comparison to other related snakes and almost twice the size of its close cousin, the amethystine python ( Morellia amethystina) . Scientists don’t know much about its mating habits in the wild, or any of its habits really, but in captivity, these snakes have mated in July and laid eggs in November. The clutch size was small, and only 6-9 eggs were deposited. This might be one of the least dangerous python species. Oenpelli pythons are nonvenomous, so there’s nothing to fear from that bite (other than razor-sharp teeth). They’re not usually inclined to bite, but any animal will bite, given the right set of circumstances. Aside from that, their sheer rarity makes even a brief encounter highly unlikely. As remote as their home range is, we don’t have a lot of information on how they interact with humans in the wild. However, a few videos have shown an Oenpelli python just cruising past the videographer as if they didn’t have a care in the world. Ironically, the remote nature of their home that makes surveying them difficult might be something that helps preserve the species.",

    "Name": "Ghost Crab",
    "Features": "Its eyestalks",
    "Text": "Ghost crabs are one of the most populous crab species in the world and are found on beaches from Oman to Polynesia to Australia to Florida to Egypt and Greece. Ghost crabs, also called sand crabs, can be told from their boxy shape, their sometimes horned eyestalks, and the uneven size of their claws. They can move surprisingly quickly, and the fewer legs they use the faster they are. Although they use eight of their 10 legs to walk normally, at their fastest only the first and second pairs of their walking legs are in play. Ghost crabs are members of the subfamily Ocypodinae, which is found in the Ocypodidae family. Ocypode comes from Greek and means “swift-footed,” which describes the surprisingly fast way these crabs can scuttle over the sand. There are two genera in this subfamily: Ocypode and Hoplocypode . In the genus Ocypode, there are 20 species, but there’s only one species in Hoplocypode : H. occidentalis . Besides Hoplocypode occidentalis , the species of this type of crab are: These crabs have a boxy little body, and most species are pale with the exception of species such as O. gaudichaudii , the painted ghost crab. Their name comes not just from their general pallor, but from the fact that they hunt at night. Two characteristics that identify ghost crabs are that both the males and the females have claws of different sizes. This differentiates them from their cousins the fiddler crabs , where unequal size claws are found only on the males. The claws of most ghost crabs also have ridges that allow the animal to produce sounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Ghost crabs, or sand crabs, also have large and long eyestalks. In some of the Ocypode species, the eyestalks are horned or have stiles. The horns help biologists identify the species. They have huge corneas that are found on an eyestalk’s bottom half. Their walking legs are longer than the claws. This allows them to move quickly and easily over the sandy beaches where they live. Ghost crabs are found near warmer waters all over the world, like those off the coast of Florida or India . These semiterrestrial crabs dig burrows in sand and mud found in that zone between the high and low tide on beaches on the oceans or estuaries. There are 21 species of sand crab, and though their habitat has been disrupted by human activity, their population is fairly healthy. Most sand crabs are found in the Indo-Pacific region, while a handful of species are found in the Mediterranean , the Pacific coast of North America , and along the Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts down to Florida and further south to Brazil . Despite their small size, ghost crabs don’t have a great many predators. Besides the ability to change color, other adaptations that evolved for both hunting and avoiding predation are their speed and their nocturnal lifestyle. Still, ghost crabs are taken by shorebirds and raccoons . The crabs themselves prey on leatherback turtle eggs and hatchlings, which is problematic since the leatherback turtle is endangered. They also eat smaller crabs, other marine arthropods, and insects. Besides hunting for food, ghost crabs are scavengers and cache food in their burrows. Ghost crabs can mate all year, though there are some species where the female ovulates only in early spring and again in summer. They are unlike other crabs of their Infraorder in that the female can mate when her shell has hardened after a molt. This is one of the adaptations the crabs made when ithey became semiterrestrial. Males posture and make sounds to both attract females and challenge other males. Usually, the male crabs don’t make contact, but if one doesn’t submit, the stronger one shoves him out of the way. Fertilization is internal and mating usually happens near the male’s burrow. The sperm comes in a fluid that hardens and forms a plug in the female to make sure her eggs are not fertilized by a rival crab. The female can store sperm for a while, but when the eggs are fertilized, they emerge and stick to her abdomen. Since the eggs look like berries, a female carrying her eggs this way is referred to as berried. The female makes sure the eggs are kept hydrated and may sometimes swim upside down for this purpose. When the crab larvae hatch, the female shakes them off into the water. They are so tiny at this stage that they become part of the zooplankton and are swept along on the ocean currents. The baby ghost crab has five molts before it reaches the megalopa stage. It stays in that stage for a little over a month. If it survives to molt one more time, it leaves the sea for the land. Ghost crabs are ready to mate when they are about a year old and have a lifespan of about three years. The ghost crab population is healthy as of 2021, though it has decreased due to human activity, climate change, and pollution. Though ghost crabs are edible, they are considered too small in size to be good eating.",

    "Name": "Arizona Black Rattlesnake",
    "Text": "The Arizona black rattlesnake was the first rattlesnake seen interacting socially with other rattlesnakes. This venomous snake is usually between two and four feet long. The adults are dark brown to almost black, and juveniles are more brightly patterned. They live in the forests of Arizona and western New Mexico at altitudes above 4,000 feet. Arizona black rattlesnakes live at high altitudes in heavily forested areas of Arizona and western New Mexico. They thrive in cooler, moister conditions that the forests offer. They are often coiled up in leaf litter or under rocks, waiting for a meal to stumble near enough to strike. Many people say that they look like cow pies until they get close enough to spot their rattles and pitviper heads. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These snakes are most active from late March to late October. They retreat to a communal den to hibernate between late October and early March. Each year, they return to the same den, with young and mature snakes sharing hibernation space. Arizona black rattlesnakes appear to have some maternal instincts. As with other pit vipers, females stay with their young after birth for seven to 14 days or until their first shed. Scientists say that females sometimes cooperatively parent their young. A group of researchers discovered this for themselves when they began photographing a female and her brood in Arizona. A typically passive female, this snake “Poked her head out of her shelter and then proceeded to crawl from her refuge toward us, still rattling, and glaring directly at us. Our once-placid Woody was now fearless and wanted us to know she would not tolerate our advance.” The Arizona black rattlesnake’s scientific name is Crotalus cerberus , with its genus name describing its rattle ( Crotalus ). The specific epithet, cerberus, means spotted and originates in Greek with Kerberos . In Greek mythology, Cerberus was the three-headed guardian of the Underworld. In 1875, Elliot Coues described it as “Particularly repulsive due to the great size to which it attains, the caliber of the body, and the black color.” Coues called it the black rattlesnake , and the name stuck. It is endemic to Arizona and far western New Mexico, so it’s commonly called the Arizona black rattlesnake. Although many people also call it a timber rattlesnake because of where it lives, this isn’t the timber rattlesnake of central and eastern United States. That is a different species: Crotalus horridus . The Arizona black rattlesnake is a member of the Crotalus genus of venomous pit vipers in the family Viperidae, which scientists believe originated between 56 million and 48 million years ago in the early Eocene. There are a few theories on how rattlesnakes’ rattles evolved. One is their rattling behavior began with a defensive method, with the snakes rustling leaf litter to startle bison who shared their original habitats. Another is that the snakes’ excess shredded skin produced noise that could ward off predators. Snakes are thought to have developed keratin callouses on their tails, creating genetic differences that led to the evolution of rattles. The Arizona black rattlesnake was formerly classified as a subspecies of the prairie rattlesnake ( Crotalus viridis ) before being elevated to a full species. The National Parks Service completed a survey from 2003 to 2005 and determined that the species is relatively rare. Unfortunately, the species’ rarity made it impossible to collect enough information to estimate their population. However, the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish listed them as a “Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN)” in the State Wildlife Action Plan for New Mexico (NMDGF 2016). The IUCN has not assessed the Arizona black rattlesnake for inclusion in the IUCN Redlist. The Arizona black rattlesnake is one of 13 rattlesnakes that are present in Arizona. This snake is a medium size, heavy-bodied, and has a spade-shaped head. Juvenile Arizona black rattlesnakes have a base color that is light gray or brown with dark brown to black blotches that are roughly oval to rectangle-shaped running down the length of their backs that can end in bands around the tail. In addition, they have dark lines on the side of their heads, bordered by white or grayish-white, that usually cross over the top of their snout. The lines sweep back diagonally downward, and the dark line continues to the end of their jaw, the effect of which is a masked appearance. Over time, the snakes darken and become brown or nearly black, making their patterns difficult or impossible to see. Some Arizona black rattlesnakes have a unique ability: they can rapidly change colors under certain conditions. For example, a nearly black snake becomes a gray snake with a clear pattern in a few minutes, then back to normal when they relax. In addition, captive snakes sometimes lighten after feeding, and stressful events like being captured can trigger a color change. That’s not the only fascinating thing about their rapid color change! They also appear able to control the color change, and some exhibit darker coloring during the day and lighter at night. Like all rattlesnake species, they have a very advanced venom-delivery system. Rattlesnakes have fangs hinged at the base that fold up into their mouths. Like a hypodermic needle, their fangs are hollow and directly attached to venom glands. This structure allows rattlesnakes to grow much larger fangs that inject venom deeply into their victim. These rattlesnakes are considered moderately venomous, and a bite from one requires immediate medical care. However, they are not aggressive snakes; they are pretty docile. Most bites occur on the hands and feet because someone stepped on or otherwise harassed them. This species was the first that scientists observed exhibiting social behavior, such as communal parenting, sharing basking locations, and interacting with other snakes of its species. They often nest with other snakes, sharing den space, and the females share parenting duties. Most interactions with humans and Arizona black rattlesnakes happen when the snake passes through camping areas and across roads or paths. This snake will move along quickly if given the time to do so and doesn’t want to be near people.",

    "Name": "Green June Beetle",
    "Features": "Metallic green coloring",
    "Text": "The green June beetle is also called the June beetle, May beetle, or June bug, and they are abundant in the South of Canada and the eastern United States. These bugs are notorious for their destructive and violent behavior. As a result, they are particularly problematic for farmers in Texas. Green June beetles are diurnal and will feed on crops and fruits. While they are less than a few inches big, they can cause a lot of damage. These beetles burrow into the soil at night and will emerge at first light. They derived their name from the month they are most active, June. Unfortunately, it is not easy to get rid of these beetles. Farmers have tried numerous strategies, and most are unsuccessful. The green June beetle’s scientific name is Cotinis nitida, and it belongs to the order Coleoptera , which consists of 360 000 species of beetles and weevils. It is the biggest order in the class Insecta and represents approximately 40% of insect species. June bugs are members of the family Scarabaeidae . There are over 1000 species of this family in North America alone. While members differ in size, they are instantly identifiable by their oval bodies, scalloped front tibiae, five-segmented tarsi, and lamellate antennae. In addition, they prefer feeding on flowers, plants, and dung. A beetle very similar to the green June beetle is the figeater beetle ( Cotinis mutabilis ) which belongs to the same Genus. These two beetles are often mistaken for each other because of their striking resemblance. Green June beetles are a stunning emerald color with golden or tan borders. There are also specs of gold on the wing coverings (elytra). Additionally, they have metallic bellies that are part brown and part green. Furthermore, their big black eyes are perched on either side of their green heads, and they have short brown antennae that split at the tips. Lastly, these green bugs can get pretty big and easily measure over an inch long. Due to their ability to fly, the green June beetle can be found almost anywhere. These beetles are diurnal, so they are drawn to lights when they are out at night. However, it’s uncommon to see them during the winter, and they are only generally sighted in May and June. June bugs are mainly found in agricultural areas, woodland borders, and in homes or gardens. In addition, they are commonly seen near compost heaps, where plenty of decaying plant matter can be eaten. Sometimes large numbers of adult June beetles are seen flying above the ground. However, the larvae live in rich soil or manure. In the Southeastern USA, adult June beetles have a varied diet but prefer stone fruit crops like plums and peaches. However, they can also consume quince, nectarines, raspberries, and apples. In addition, they drink from open flowers like blossoms, hollyhocks, and buttercups. While these beetles are not harmful to humans, they bore into ripe fruit and leave behind feces. The green June beetle completes its entire lifecycle in just one year. These beetles mate in the early morning. Females attract males by leaving scented milky fluid trails. Mating does not take long, only a few minutes. Once the female is fertilized, she will crawl into her burrow, which is usually built under matted grass. Female June beetles can lay between 60 to 70 eggs in their burrows over a 14-day period. At first, eggs are white in color and have an elliptical shape, but they gradually become more spherical as the larvae start to grow. After around 18 days, the eggs begin to hatch, and white grubs will emerge. Grubs grow to over 1.6 inches long and have a white body with a brownish-black head and brown spirals running down the sides of their bodies. These grubs will molt twice before the temperature decreases before winter. As they grow, they will change color to a shiny yellowish-white, which turns to a bluish-green toward the head and tail. In addition, they have stiff ambulatory bristles on their bodies, which help them with movement, as they generally travel on their backs. They feed off roots, decomposing organic matter, and kill the plants from the bottom up. They are at their most destructive when in their second instar stage and require more food to support their development. The larvae cause significant damage to lawns or turf grass. In fact, they are more dangerous to crops in their larval stage than as adults. They will start to pupate after the third larval stage, and this phase lasts up to nine months. The larvae will excrete a viscid fluid and fasten it with dirt particles to construct its oval cocoon. At first, the cocoon is white but will develop a green tint just before the beetle emerges. The adults start to emerge in May or June, 18 days after they begin to pupate. These beetles are typically 0.6 to 0.9 inches long and 0.5 inches wide. Their color differs from brown with green stripes to metallic green. Additionally, the elytra vary from orange-yellow to light brown. These beetles prefer to feed on various fruits like: However, they are more attracted to decomposing or bruised fruit, which is why their larvae are considered more damaging. There are several ways to prevent and remove green June beetles from your home; they include: You can make your own green June beetle trap from a large container with a wide-opening funnel top and some fruit juice. The beetles will enter the container and travel down to the juice but won’t be able to escape. While introducing natural predators won’t eliminate the entire population of June bugs, they do significantly reduce the numbers. Parasitic wasps are a good option as they burrow into the ground and paralyze the larvae before laying eggs on them. Once these wasp eggs hatch, they will start to feed on the grub. Other predators include: You can encourage these predators to move to your garden by providing them with a water source, shelter, and feeders. BT is an effective naturally occurring bacteria that will kill grubs when applied to flowerbeds and grass. It is organic and harmless to humans and pets, which benefits everyone. However, only use this product for severe infestations, and it should always be used with caution. Help mask dead turf and encourage recovery by maintaining a healthy lawn. In addition, if damage to your grass begins to appear, overseed with grass seed to promote rapid growth. Additionally, Continuous turf irrigation during June will deter females from laying their eggs beneath the soil, and if you have fruit, harvest them early and discard fallen fruit.",

    "Name": "Underwing Moth",
    "Features": "Colorful rear wing",
    "Text": "The Catocala , also known as the underwing moth, is a genus of moths with bark-like forewings and very bright underwings. They are common in North America , Asia, and Europe and are known for their unique ability to camouflage with their environment and keep predators away by flashing their rear wings. Scientifically known as Catocala, the underwing moths are a genus that belongs to the family Erebidae. They were named by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1802. This genus contains at least 250-260 species of underwing moths. The name Catocala comes from two greek words – kato, meaning lower, and kalos meaning beautiful. This name comes from the beautiful rear wings of these moths. This name is pronounced as kah-TAH-kuh-luh. The underwing moths have very colorful and bright rear wings. Their forewings look like tree bark or leaves, which allows them to hide from their predators. On the other hand, their rear wings are bright in color and patterned in different ways. When camouflaging, they conceal their rear wings to prevent predators from seeing them. Their hind wings have stripes, which can vary in color to orange, pink, white, red, or black, depending on the species. When threatened, these moths show their rear wings, which throws off the enemy – a phenomenon known as deflective coloration . When flying, the underwing moths occasionally hide their rear wings in mid-air to deceive possible predators, also called flash coloration. These moths usually have a wingspan of about 2-5 inches, almost as long as a human thumb. The caterpillars of an underwing moth are grey or brown, allowing them to camouflage into their habitat. In addition, underwing moth larvae can change color to blend with their environment. The underwing moth is a nocturnal genus, meaning they spend the day resting on trees and the nights wandering. At night, they fly from tree to tree in search of food or, during the breeding season, a place to lay their eggs. This genus of moths is docile, and they tend to stick to themselves. So they do not fly in groups but remain solitary. They remain passive unless threatened or bothered, which is when they begin to move rapidly and show their rear wings. They also start flapping their wings so fast that it appears as though they are vibrating. Another behavior of the underwing moth is “playing dead.” They can become extraordinarily still if they feel threatened to try and cause predators to lose interest. Underwing moths also use camouflage to protect themselves. They only sit on trees that have the same color as their forewings, making them almost indistinguishable from the bark. It is thought that any loud noise triggers their sense of smell instead of a startled response. In addition, they have sensory organs that allow them to detect vibrations or sounds at a specific frequency, such as that of a bat , which is one of their main predators. Underwing moths live in forests with the same color bark as their wings, allowing them to camouflage effectively. This means that they typically thrive in deciduous trees. However, they can also be found in caves, under rocks and ledges, and in other bushes or areas that allow them to camouflage. The caterpillars of underwing moths live in tree canopies or soil. During the day, they hide at the trunk base, and at night they return to the tree to feed on the leaves. Almost half of all underwing moth species are found in North America, and the remaining species are found in Asia and Europe. In addition, a few unique species are found in the northern Neotropics and Indomalaya. Underwing moths are herbivores meaning that their diet is entirely based on plants. Most of the species feed on deciduous tree leaves in the forest. However, they can also feed on grass and other vegetation in their habitat. The underwing moths are preyed on by larger carnivorous animals and insectivores. These include, but are not limited to, birds, bats, lizards, and spiders. The moths often escape these predators by flashing their rear wings and rapidly flapping their wings. The bright color of their rear wings also gives some predators the impression that they are poisonous. However, they are not poisonous creatures. The primary food of an underwing moth varies depending on its habitat and the surrounding trees. But overall, this genus feeds on the leaves of the trees within their habitat, usually deciduous trees. They can also feed on grass and other plants within their habitat. Underwing moth caterpillars typically eat poplars and willows. Since underwing moths are tiny creatures, they are preyed on by many larger animals, such as birds, bats , lizards , and spiders . Predators aside, other threats that underwing moths face are habitat loss, deforestation, and pesticides. Too much artificial light and a sudden climate change also significantly affect their population. The underwing moth goes through a complete lifecycle before becoming fully grown. In the mating season, males locate the females by their pheromones. And once the mating process has occurred, the female lays her eggs soon after. In the summer, the female underwing moths deposit eggs on tree branches, either one at a time or in small clusters. These eggs only take 4-10 days to hatch if laid during the summer, but in winter, it can take up to 3 weeks. Once they hatch, they become a worm-like larva known as a caterpillar . At this stage of the cycle, they do not have wings. Instead, they wriggle around and hide on the branches of trees. After about one month, they become adult moths, and the cycle repeats. Baby underwing moths are called caterpillars and have elongated bodies with no wings. These are similar larvae to butterflies , except they are brown and grey instead, while butterfly caterpillars are more colorful. They eat plant material and leaves in their habitat and take about a month to fully mature. At the end of the caterpillar’s cycle, they form a chrysalis, and its body digests itself and forms an entirely new body with wings. The average lifespan of an underwing moth is not very long, only one to six months, after which they begin to wear out and spend less time flying. Towards the end of their lives, they become susceptible to some common ailments. These include: The overall population of the underwing moth genus is unknown. There are around 250-260 underwing moth species living all over the world, most of which have stable populations. However, two of their species in Missouri have a status of Vulnerable. The rest remain Least Concern , considering their rapid reproductive cycle.",

The gray tree frog is a large species of tree frog that can take on many colors despite its name. It is commonly found in southeastern Canada and the eastern United States . The gray tree frog spends most of its life high up among the trees and is very adept at navigating the branches thanks to its sticky feet. The gray tree frog’s scientific name is Hyla versicolor , which is derived from the Latin for “variable color” due to its ability to alter the color of its skin based on certain factors, such as being a lighter shade at night and a darker tone during the day. It belongs to the Hylidae Family and Amphibia Class. Other common names for the gray tree frog are the eastern gray treefrog, northern gray treefrog, common gray treefrog, and tetraploid gray treefrog. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Genetic studies have shown that the gray tree frog evolved due to “multiple hybrid events” involving ancestors that have two sets of chromosomes. The species has been found to have DNA from Cope’s gray tree frog ( H. chrysoscelis ) and two other species that are now extinct but most likely were present in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the gray tree frog’s range. These frogs are almost indistinguishable from the Cope’s gray tree frog. The Cope’s gray tree frog has the same appearance as the gray tree frog and can only be identified by a slightly slower call. They are otherwise completely separate species, with the gray tree frog having twice as many chromosomes as the Cope’s gray tree frog. It’s uncertain how the gray tree frog evolved to be able to change color. Although it may seem like a chameleon in its abilities to adapt its color to match its environment in order to evade predators or as a reaction to the time of the day and related temperatures, there are several differences between the two animals. Apart from the frog being an amphibian and the chameleon a reptile, chameleons can change to a broader range of colors (including pink, orange, red, yellow, and blue), differing degrees of brightness, and combinations of tones. The chameleon is also faster at its color changes than the gray tree frog, and there are other reasons besides camouflage for it to shift shades such as for social signaling. These frogs are particularly unique because they are not necessarily always gray. Instead, their color variation can range from gray to green or even brown. It truly depends on its current environment and activities. It regularly alters its color to match tree bark, but its belly is usually always white. The gray tree frog is very warty in appearance. These frogs utilize a special grip on their hands and feet that allows them to climb vertically or horizontally with ease on trees and other objects. They are considered a larger example of a tree frog , being anywhere from 1.25 to 2.25 inches long depending on the sex. So on average, the frog is about three-and-a-half times as long as an aspirin tablet. Compared to other tree frogs, like the pinewood tree frog and squirrel tree frog, the gray tree frog has a weightier build. Two distinct features of adult frogs are the light spot beneath the eye and the bright orange coloration on the inner thigh. This bright color variation probably serves as a warning to potential predators. These frogs are solitary creatures and only spend time together during the breeding season. All other times of the year, they spend time hiding during the day and hunting during the night. During the day, they can be found disguising themselves under bark, rotten logs, leaves, and tree roots. It produces a sticky fluid from the tips of its hands and feet that allow it to climb into trees to hunt for food. The male of the species has a loud and almost birdlike call. It will make this call for hours after dusk as a way to establish a breeding territory. The males can be aggressive, but generally only in the breeding season when they need to defend their territory. They hibernate in the winter thanks to an adaptation that allows 80% of their body to freeze. They can survive extremely cold temperatures by hiding under rocks and other forest objects. These frogs are common in the eastern part of the United States and parts of southeastern Canada . This includes northern Florida over to central Texas, as well as all of South Carolina and Georgia. Being tree frog , they can usually be found in wooded areas, whether that is a forest or agricultural area. They will not be found far away from either trees or a source of water, like a swamp or pond. They spend most of their time in high treetops but can be identified in the vegetation of fishless wetlands during their breeding season. In the summertime, it is not unusual for people to see them on windows looking for the bugs attracted to artificial lights. This species of tree frog mainly feeds on different types of insects , such as snails , spiders , beetles , and the larvae of those insects. It spends most of its days high in treetops, where it can easily find moths , tree crickets, ants , flies , beetles , plant lice, spiders , and mites. It is comfortable jumping between branches to seek out its prey. They are opportunistic and will eat smaller frogs if given a chance. These frogs are very common and probably have a large population. However, regional populations in both the United States and Canada have to deal with the threats of habitat loss, water pollution, invasive species, and chytrid fungus. Different species of snakes , birds , small mammals , and even other frogs prey on these frogs. They spend most of their lives in the treetops to avoid these types of predators. They are also nocturnal and active at night to avoid predation. A known threat to these frogs is pesticides and insecticides that they consume on insects. These chemicals may have harmful long-term effects. The breeding season occurs after the frog wakes up from hibernation, in late spring and early summer. Males will defend an area around a water source and call out after dusk to find potential mates. Females will lay eggs in masses at the surface following mating. Each female will lay somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 eggs in batches of 10 to 40. The eggs hatch between 3 and 7 days. Young frogs are called tadpoles and live in the pond or water source they were hatched in until they are 4 to 8 weeks old. Then they complete a metamorphosis process and become young gray tree frogs or froglets. The frog’s lifespan is believed to be on average 7 to 9 years. This lifespan is similar for males and females. These frogs are known to be widely distributed across their habitat in the U.S. and Canada . However, there are no accurate counts of its population in any region. These frogs are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Most scientists believe there to be a large population that is generally not in danger of extinction any time soon.",

    "Name": "Kouprey",
    "Features": "Dorsal hump",
    "Text": "The kouprey (also known as the Cambodian forest ox or wild forest ox) is a type of ox that is native to Southeast Asia. They are the national animal of Cambodia and mainly dwell in a forest environment. The kouprey is considered to be one of the rarest animals on the planet, and at one point they were even believed to be extinct. There has not been many sighting of the kouprey since their discovery in 1937, but recent camera footage has shown that there are still kouprey roaming around, with parts of them being sold illegally. As a type of ox, the kouprey is an interesting animal that many of you might not have known existed, which we will discuss in this article. The kouprey’s scientific name is Bos sauveli , and they belong to the Bovidae family in the Bos genus from the order Artiodactyla. The kouprey is a moderately sized animal, reaching around 6.9 to 7.5 feet in length with a height of 5.6 to 6.2 feet, weighing anywhere between 1,500 to 2,100 pounds. Females tend to be smaller and weigh less than males, with a lighter coloration. Even though kouprey are heavy animals, they can still run quite fast at around 32 kilometers per hour. Kouprey have a defined dorsal hump on their backs and a long, narrow tail that reaches a length of 3.3 feet and ends with a furry patch. Both male and female kouprey have horns. The horns of the kouprey are the same size in both males and females, at around 32 inches in length. The female kouprey horns have a lyre shape, while the males are more intimidating and arch forward with a curved base. The kouprey nostrils are notched and they have an elongated face. Their legs are long, with a whitish-grey color past their knees that look like stockings. You can see kouprey in colors that range from grey, dark brown, and even black, but they all start off with a reddish color as a baby and juvenile before they turn 6 months old and begin to change color. One of the most distinctive features of this species is that their horns become frayed, especially in older males (bulls). The kouprey was first described in 1937 by the French zoologist, Achille Urbain after a young male kouprey was sent to the Paris Zoological Park. Urbain then described the kouprey as a holotype. At the time of the koupreys discovery, there were believed to be no more than 2,000 in the wild, which was in Thailand, northern Cambodia, western Vietnam , and the southern part of Laos. Kouprey is native to Cambodia, but now there are only a few left in the wild, making them rare. Throughout history, there have only been a few sightings of the kouprey, but no verified sightings occurred between 1969 and 1970, making scientists believe that they went extinct from their natural habitat. It was thought that only 100 koupreys were still in the wild, but some believe there to be up to 300. Regardless, this is still a small amount of kouprey in the wild. There are many interesting behaviors that have been discovered in a kouprey herd. The herd usually consists of around 20 koupreys that group together, with one female being dominant and leading the herd. As the kouprey bulls get older, they usually become solitary and leave the herd. Some bulls even start up a small all-males herd, while the rest of the herd consists of young bulls, females (cows), and their calves. In some cases, when all the males leave the herd, only the cows and their calves will remain and form their own small herd. Sometimes, the all-male herd and the rest of the herd join together when they encounter one another again. Koupreys are diurnal animals, that prefer to stay out in the open at night and take shelter in their forestry homes during the day. This diurnal behavior could be another reason that humans rarely see these animals. Kouprey can travel up to 15 kilometers a night in search of food and shelter, which is how the herds will cross paths and end up with each other again. Kouprey will also take a dip in mud baths and waterholes, which help repel insects and protect them from the harsh sun. The kouprey’s habitat consists of dry, open forests, with thick trees that they spend the day hiding under. However, when it gets hot, they will move to a denser forest that has better shade. Kouprey will also inhabit orchard savannas and barren land with trees, usually on low hills or plains. During the rainy seasons, herds by the lower plains will start to move towards the hills in search of higher ground, usually because of any flooding that occurs. They are distributed throughout Cambodia, their land of origin, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Kouprey is also distributed in wildlife sanctuaries, which are crucial for the species’ survival since not many can be found in the wild. The numbers and sightings of the kouprey are so low, that they are believed to be extinct in eastern Cambodia, aside from being found in the Mondulkiri Protected Forest . So far, kouprey can be found in the Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, the Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary. Koupreys are herbivores that spend most of their time grazing. They eat a variety of grasses which forms the main part of their diet, along with plant shoots such as koompassia, ploong, and bamboo . They will also consume sedges, and in the sanctuaries, they will enjoy salt licks as part of their diet. The main threat and predator to kouprey are humans, who use the animal for their horns and body parts to be sold illegally on the black market. Habitat destruction from logging and agricultural developments due to humans is another reason for their low numbers in the wild. Another threat that the kouprey face is from hunters, who then use parts of the kouprey for medicine, bush meat, subsistence, and money from trading. Parts of the kouprey sell for a lot of money on this illegal market, making them a desirable trophy, the skulls, and horns of the kouprey are also a target of the illegal wildlife trade, contributing to the kouprey extinction. Groups of mature bulls will seek out any of the female koupreys in heat (estrus), even if they have formed their own male-dominated herd. The male will then pursue the female until she is willing to mate. Once mating occurs, the female has a gestation period between 8 to 9 months, much like a human, and she will separate herself from the herd to give birth. Once the calf is born and around one month old, the female kouprey will then rejoin her original herd. The calves will have a red coloration, that changes as they get older to adult color. Kouprey lives for up to 20 years, similar to that of an ox, cow, and many other bovine animals. The kouprey population is very low, making them critically endangered and vulnerable to extinction according to the IUCN red list. They are also the most endangered mammal on the planet. There is now an estimation of 100 to 300 kouprey left in the wild, with speculation on whether they have gone extinct in their native habitat. This makes conservation important for the kouprey, and if we don’t do something soon, this animal can go extinct.",

    "Name": "Thorny Devil",
    "Text": "The thorny devil is covered in thorny spikes that make it look like a miniature dragon. A small lizard native to Australia , the thorny devil is known by various other names like a thorny dragon, moloch, and mountain devil. It’s mainly active during the day and can change colors to blend into its environment. As intimidating as it looks, the thorny devil is actually a slow-moving lizard that mainly eats ants . It has a “fake head” behind its neck that works as a way to fool predators. Thorny devils sport a unique gait, which is slow and halting with their tails straight up in the air. Additionally, there are between four and six different color variations of thorny devils, though the number of recognized morphs varies depending on the source. The “red morph,” “yellow morph,” “orange morph,” “grey morph,” and possibly others are among them. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . In 1841, biologist John Edward Gray provided the first description of the thorny devil, which is currently the only species in the Moloch genus. Although some taxonomists believe that there may be another undiscovered species in the wild, this has not been confirmed. The thorny devil is not closely related to the North American horned lizards of the Phrynosoma genus, even though they share a similar appearance. This resemblance is generally considered to be the result of convergent evolution. The North American horned lizards, which belong to the Phrynosoma genus and are known for their horns, also eat ants like the thorny devil. While other lizards may have some spines, none are quite as spiky as these two species. Additionally, Moloch and Phrynosoma are frequently used as an example of convergent evolution, which means that they developed similar features independently of each other due to similar ecological pressures. The scientific name of the thorny devil is Moloch horridus . The lizard belongs to the kingdom Animalia, the phylum Chordata, the class Reptilia, the order Squamata, the suborder Iguania, the family Agamidae, the subfamily Amphibolurinae and the genus Moloch . The name Moloch horridus comes from the Canaanite demon god named Moloch, and horridus, which means dreadful or thorny. The name is related to the thorny devil’s imposing devilish appearance with spines and spikes all over its body. The thorny devil has a number of other nicknames, including the following: The lizard’s unique appearance definitely makes it stand out, but it’s also an adaptation. The lizards are covered with large spines all over their bodies. The spikes are mostly boneless, except for on the lizard’s skull. The thorny devil isn’t a very big lizard, however. It grows up to around eight inches total, including the tail. Females are larger than males. Another unique aspect of their appearance is their ability to change color to match their habitat and even the time of day. In the mornings when temperatures are cooler, the animal has brown or olive skin. They become light yellow as the temperature gets higher in the afternoon. The thorny devil’s appearance is mainly to blend in with its environment and ward off predators. These animals are active in a range of temperatures in their native habitat. They are the most active between March and May, and from August through December. They go almost totally inactive between January and February when the temperatures are the highest, and also during June and July when temperatures are the coldest. During these times, the lizard will dig burrows in the ground and hide. When the animal is active, its daily routine is to emerge from its shrub resting spot and warm itself on the sand. Thorny devils roam a small area to eat ants and defecate. They roam further when they are looking for mates. The lizards walk with a unique slow, halting gait. The animal is mostly solitary, and they are not particularly territorial so their territory may overlap with other lizards. Australia’s Great Sandy Desert interior provides the native habitat for the lizard. They can be found in sandy deserts and scrub with sandy soil. They are only found in areas with significant sandy soil. They don’t like areas with rocky or hard soil. The lizard has unique physical features that enable it to survive in the arid parts of Australia. Moisture-attracting grooves between the lizard’s scales can channel any minute amount of water to their mouths. This means that even just collected dew from overnight or on vegetation can provide water for the animal. In extreme situations, the lizard can also bury itself in the sand to draw moisture to its scales. The animal mainly eats ants . The spinifex and rainbow ant are two preferred ant species. The lizard isn’t a particularly active predator. It typically sits and waits for ants to cross its path and then laps them up with its sticky tongue. They only feed in temperatures above 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Depending on the time of year, this might mean only in the morning or only in the afternoon. The lizard can eat thousands of ants in one day, but the average amount is about 750 ants per day. Birds of prey and goannas are natural predators of the animal. These lizards are carnivores and specifically, insectivores. They mainly eat ants and might eat thousands of ants in a single day. The main predators of these animals are Australian bustards, black-breasted bustards, goanna lizards, and humans. It’s also possible that dingos , foxes, and snakes might try to eat them. However, these lizards are hard to see due to their natural camouflage and spiny skin. They move slowly with jerky movements, and they will freeze completely motionless when they sense a threat. This makes them fairly unattractive prey. The main threat to these lizards is the loss of their ant food source. This is possible in areas where humans kill ants as pests. However, these animals currently have a conservation status of least concern , which means that they are not facing any significant threat to their habitat or population. The mating behavior of the thorny devil is not well-known. Limited observation shows that males seek out females and will mate if the female is receptive. The thorny devil usually mates and lays eggs in the late winter into the early summer. Females lay their eggs in burrows. These burrows are different from the normal burrows used by the lizard. They are usually dug into sand ridges that face south. The females lay between three and 10 eggs with an average of eight. The eggs are incubated for a period between 90 and 132 days. The babies eat their own egg casings before leaving the burrow. Thorny devils generally live between six and 20 years in the wild. There is no confirmed population data for these lizards. The IUCN finds that the lizard is very common in its local habitat, but there is no firm population estimate. Thorny devils face no serious threats to their habitat or numbers, and their conservation is listed as the least concern .",

    "Name": "Eastern Cottontail",
    "Features": "Fluffy white tail",
    "Text": "The eastern cottontail belongs to the rabbit and hare family Leporidae. They range throughout North America , Latin America, and northern South America . In fact, this rabbit ranks as the most common rabbit species in all of North America. They are prolific breeders, with a single female capable of producing up to 35 kits in a year. You are most likely to spot them in the morning or evening when they come out from cover to feed. That said, you can find them out in the open at any time of day. Like all rabbits, the eastern cottontail is a mammal in the class Mammalia. It is a member of the order Lagomorpha, which includes two families, Leporidae and Ochotonidae. It belongs to the family Leporidae, which includes both rabbits and hares. The term Leporidae derives from the Latin word lepus, meaning “hare,” and the suffix – idae, meaning “resembling” or “form of.” In other words, Leporidae, translates to “those that resemble hares.” The eastern cottontail is part of the cottontail rabbit genus Sylvilagus. Its genus name stems from the Latin word sylva, meaning “woods,” and the Greek word lagōs, meaning “hare.” Meanwhile, its specific name, floridanus, translates roughly to “of Florida ” or “from Florida.” Like the first part of its common name, the term refers to the fact that these rabbits are most common in the eastern half of North America. Finally, the term cottontail refers to their short, cotton-ball-like tails, a characteristic feature of every species in the Sylvilagus genus. The average eastern cottontail features a squat, robust body. They possess long ears and feet, and a short, fluffy tail. Most possess red-brown or gray-brown fur, although the underside and tail both appear white. Additionally, their coat can change color and length depending on the season. During winter, they tend to look grayer and have longer hair. Their longer hair helps to keep them warm, while the increased gray in their coat allows them to blend into their surrounding environment more easily. Meanwhile, eastern cottontails look browner and have shorter hair during the summer. On average, eastern cottontails measure between 14 and 19 inches long and weigh around 2.6 pounds. That said, they can weigh anywhere from 1.8 to 4.4 pounds, with females typically weighing heavier than males. Generally speaking, eastern cottontails that live farther north tend to grow larger than cottontails that live in southern regions. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Fossil records indicate that the first rabbits and hares evolved sometime during the late Eocene Epoch. This means that the ancient ancestors of modern cottontails emerged at least 33 million years ago. Today, the eastern cottontail rabbit serves as the type species for the genus Sylvilagus. Outside of its own genus, the closest relative of them is the pygmy rabbit ( Brachylagus idahoensis ). Meanwhile, eastern cottontails are more distantly related to European and Asian rabbits, and even further removed from hares. Eastern cottontail rabbits are notoriously skittish. When threatened, they often run in a zigzag pattern to escape their pursuer. At top speed, they can run up to 18 miles per hour. That said, they rarely come out in the open except when feeding. When not feeding, they spend most of their time hiding in thick cover or in underground burrows. Eastern cottontails are crepuscular, meaning they become most active around dusk and dawn. However, you can encounter them outside at any time of the day. Even in cold climates, they do not hibernate and thus stay active year-round. When searching for threats, eastern cottontails may stand up on their hind legs. This increases their ability to hear any nearby predators. You’re unlikely to spot them out in the open on windy or rainy days, as the excess noise can interfere with their hearing and prevent them from detecting predators. You can find eastern cottontails throughout much of North America and Latin America. They also range throughout the northern part of South America. They are widely distributed throughout the central and eastern United States , parts of southern Canada , central and eastern Mexico , Venezuela , and Colombia . While you can find them in the northwestern and southwestern United States, they occur in much smaller ranges in these regions. Eastern cottontails often live in and around fields, meadows, pastures, and clearings. They may also live in woodlands, thickets, swamps, and wetlands . As a rule, they tend to avoid dense forests or deserts. To survive, they prefer areas that offer both plenty of food and cover for them to stay safe from predators. Despite what you may think, they do not build burrows underground. Instead, they will take over burrows vacated by other animals, or construct nests above ground in deep cover. Like all rabbits, eastern cottontails are herbivores that feed almost exclusively on plant material. They feed on all fours and use their nose to move food directly in front of their paws. On rare occasions, they may use their paws to reach food above their heads. Generally speaking, they always eat the cleanest part of a plant first. The diet of eastern cottontails varies depending on the location. By some estimates, eastern cottontails feed on anywhere from 70 to 145 different plant species. Common food items include grasses, sedges, leaves, bark, twigs, flowers, and fruits. In summer, they mostly feed on grasses and sedges. Meanwhile, their diet shifts mostly to twigs, bark, and buds in winter. They will also sometimes eat small insects. That said, these insects are most likely consumed by accident and not purposefully targeted. Additionally, eastern cottontails consume their own feces, making them coprophagous. They produce two types of pellet droppings, one of which they consume to increase nutrient absorption. Eastern cottontail rabbits near the bottom of the food chain. As such, numerous different predators feed on them. Common mammalian predators include cats , dogs , bobcats , foxes , weasels , raccoons , and minks . Additionally, possums , skunks , and badgers may prey on juveniles. Other, non-mammalian predators include snakes and birds such as owls , hawks , and goshawks . According to most estimates, predation is the number one risk faced by eastern cottontails, with predation accounting for upwards of 40% of all eastern cottontail deaths. The breeding season for eastern cottontails typically begins in February or March and ends around September. Temperature determines the start and end of the breeding season. As a result, eastern cottontails that live in colder climates tend to start breeding later and end sooner than rabbits that breed in warmer climates. Similarly, rabbits that live in colder climates tend to have fewer litters per year compared to rabbits in warmer climates. Although eastern cottontails act skittish toward predators and humans, they can act very territorial toward other rabbits. These rabbits are promiscuous, and males typically mate with multiple females. Females rabbits have anywhere from 1 to 7 litters per year, with an average of 3 to 4 litters per female. The gestation period lasts for 25 to 35 days, after which the female gives birth to 1 to 12 kits, with 5 kits being the average. Eastern cottontail rabbits reach sexual maturity between 2 and 3 months old. Although most only live up to 15 months in the wild, they can live up to 9 years in captivity. Over the last few decades, eastern cottontail rabbit populations have declined throughout much of their native range. The main reason for this decline likely stems from a loss of prime habitat due to increased development of land for housing, transportation, or agricultural use. By some estimates, nearly 10 rabbits get killed every year in traffic collisions for every 1 mile of road in their natural range. Moreover, millions of rabbits every year get killed by predators and hunters. Despite these losses, eastern cottontail rabbits remain the most common rabbit species in the Americas. While no accurate total population metrics exist, the eastern cottontail population likely numbers in the tens or hundreds of millions. As a result, the IUCN classifies the eastern cottontail rabbit as a species of Least Concern .",

    "Name": "Orange Roughy",
    "Features": "Head riddled with muciferous canals",
    "Text": "Able to live over 200 years, the orange roughy is a deep-sea fish belonging to the slimehead family Trachichthyidae. They mature extremely slowly, which makes them highly susceptible to overfishing. They possess rounded heads covered in mucous-filled canals, hence their name. When active or feeding, they tend to appear orangish-red, but they slowly lose their pigmentation when resting. They are a member of the slimehead family Trachichthyidae. In addition to the orange roughy, it is also known as the red roughy, deep sea perch, or simply slimehead. Its family name derives from the Greek words trachys , meaning “rough,” and ichthys, meaning “fish.” Slimeheads feature a network of muciferous canals running throughout their head, hence their name. They belong to the genus Hoplstethus, which derives from the Greek words hoplo , meaning “weapon” or “tool,” and stethus, meaning “breast.” Taken literally, the genus name translates as “to prick a little breast.” Meanwhile, its scientific name , atlanticus, has two alternate meanings. In Latin, atlanticus translates to “of or pertaining to the Atlantic Ocean ,” which may refer to its geographic distribution. While they live in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, you can also find orange roughy throughout the western Pacific , eastern Pacific, and Indo-Pacific. In Greek, atlanticus takes on an alternate meaning, namely “Atlantean” or “of Atlantis.” As its name implies, the orange roughy isn’t known for its beauty. It possesses a rounded head covered with muciferous canals, hence the name slimefish. The dorsal fin consists of 4 to 6 shark spines and between 15 and 19 soft rays. Meanwhile, the anal fin contains approximately 3 spines and 10 to 12 soft rays. They have a large, bluish-black mouth, rather large eyes and reddish-orange scales, but they can change color based on their activity level. They lose almost all of their pigmentation during long periods of inactivity until they appear predominantly yellowish-white. With a maximum recorded length of 30 inches and weight of 15 pounds, orange roughy rank as the largest known slimehead species. That said, most specimens measure between 14 and 18 inches on average. You can find them throughout the eastern and western Pacific, eastern Atlantic, and Indo-Pacific. Well-studied stocks include the populations around Australia , New Zealand , and Namibia , all of which operate established commercial fisheries for orange roughy. In the eastern Atlantic, they are most common off the coast of Chile . As adults, they tend to aggregate in schools of approximately 1 to 2.5 fish per square meter. They frequently congregate along the sea bed near geological structures such as seamounts and canyons. Researchers suspect that the water mixing and movement in and around these structures leads to higher concentrations of prey, which in turn attracts orange roughy and other predators. They prefer cold water between 37 and 48 degrees Fahrenheit. They are bathypelagic, meaning they spend most of their lives at considerable depths, often in the range of 590 to 5,910 feet below sea level. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Several species prey on orange roughy as juveniles and adults. Common predators of orange roughy include sharks , snake mackerels, merluccid hakes, and cutthroat eels. As for prey, the diet of orange roughy varies depending on their age and depth. Juveniles typically feed on zooplankton, shrimp , krill , small fish, and crustaceans . Meanwhile, adults primarily feed on small fish, such as Butterflyfish and Lanternfish, as well as crustaceans and squid. Orange roughy partake in a phenomenon known as resource partitioning, which consists of juveniles and adults not competing for the same food sources. For example, juveniles tend to consume more crustaceans as they decrease in depth, while adults eat fewer crustaceans at lower depths. Similarly, juveniles eat more fish close to the surface, while adults eat mostly fish and squid at lower depths. Orange roughy reproduce via broadcast spawning by releasing large, spherical eggs and sperm into the water. The eggs take around 10 to 20 days to fertilize and hatch, at which point the orange roughy larvae rise closer to the surface to develop. Although orange roughy make annual migrations, they do not breed every year. In fact, most orange rough do not reach sexual maturity until they are at least 20 years old, and some don’t breed until they reach 30 or 40 years old. In addition, females produce relatively fewer eggs compared to other fish their size. Generally speaking, a female releases approximately 22,000 eggs per kilo of body weight, which represents only about 10% of the average number of eggs produced by similar-sized fish. Throughout her lifetime, the average female may only lay around 90,000 eggs. One of the most marvelous things about orange rough is their incredible lifespan. As previously mentioned, orange roughy mature incredibly slowly. They go through metabolic phases that include high activity and feeding followed by low activity and rest. This metabolic shifting likely contributes to the orange roughy’s ability to live for so long. Researchers use several methods to estimate the age of orange roughy, including radiometric dating of trace isotopes and counting growth rings in the ear bones or otoliths. Depending on the method used, researchers estimate that orange roughy can live well over 200 years old. The oldest specimens ever caught were estimated at approximately 250 years, making them the commercial fish species with the longest life expectancy. Up until the 1970s, almost no one frequently ate them. Before then, people knew orange roughy as slimefish, which made them sound understandably unappetizing. However, all that changed thanks to a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service campaign to rename them to make them more marketable to consumers. The campaign worked, and the commercial fishing of them took off. Every year, fisheries harvest thousands of tonnes of orange roughy from the world’s oceans, primarily through the use of bottom trawling. Orange roughy has a mild and flaky texture with white or brown flesh. You can prepare it in numerous ways, including grilled, fried, baked, sauteed, or steamed. It pairs well with just a little lemon, fresh herbs, butter, and olive oil, all of which can enhance the flavor or prevent it from frying out too quickly. Orange roughy contains high levels of omega-three fatty acids, protein, vitamins A and D, and calcium while having relatively low levels of fat. At the same time, orange roughy can also have high levels of mercury. Mercury is a natural toxin that can affect brain development and kidney and nervous system health if ingested in large quantities. For millions of years, orange roughy went almost completely unnoticed as they lived out their long lives along the sea floor. However, all that changed in 1975 when scientists discovered large aggregations of orange roughy off New Zealand during a deep-sea research expedition. In the following years, commercial fisheries began targeting them in earnest due to their pleasant taste and the relative ease with which they can be caught. Unfortunately, they are ill-equipped to overcome the challenges posed by commercial fishing due to their slow rate of growth and low fecundity. In just a few short decades, several orange roughy populations declined precipitously due to overfishing. Stocks around New Zealand and Australia have seen the worst declines, and 3 out of 8 of New Zealand’s fisheries closed due to depleted stock by the 1990s. In response, numerous countries, including Australia and New Zealand, took steps to regulate fishing to maintain healthy stocks. Today, the IUCN lists the orange roughy as a Vulnerable species in recognition of the steep decline in stocks across the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere. Despite this assessment, fisheries continue to operate not just in Australia and New Zealand but around the world. Several previously closed fisheries have since reopened in recent years, and it remains to be seen whether regulations designed to protect orange rough stocks will actually manage to shelter populations long-term from the effects of commercial fishing.",

    "Name": "Linnet 2",
    "Features": "Red patch on their forehead",
    "Text": "Linnets are small songbirds that are members of the finch family. They occur in West Asia, Europe, and North-West Africa. These little birds inhabit scrublands, farmlands, hedgerows, fields, parks, and orchards. In the 19 th century, linnets were a popular cage bird, and many households kept them as pets. However, their population numbers dropped drastically during the second half of the 20 th century due to habitat loss and the pollution of the ground with pesticides and fertilizers. Although their numbers have declined by nearly 50%, they are not endangered and are listed as Least Concern on IUCN’s Redlist. Linnets occur across Asia and Europe but also inhabit parts of Western Africa . In the United Kingdom , they spread from the east coast all the way to Scotland. However, they are usually seen at low altitudes instead of higher upland regions like northwest Scotland. They occur in 67 countries, including Afghanistan , Egypt , Italy , Portugal , and China . Linnets build their nests at the ends of branches or stems hanging over the water. They construct tidy bowl-shaped nests in trees with holes, gorse bushes, and walls; sometimes, they claim nests are abandoned by other birds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The linnet’s scientific name is Linaria cannabina ; however, the European species is called Carduelis cannabina ; this is due to their preference for cannabis/marijuana, which is one of the most common foods in their diets. In addition, the word ‘linnet’ originated in the 16 th century, with ‘lin” meaning ‘flax’ because of their love for flax seeds.alle Linnets belong to the Order Passeriformes and are the most well-known typical birds that make up more than 50% of the world’s bird species, which includes birds species like: Linnets are members of the Fringillidae Family, which consists of songbirds; they are often referred to as true finches. This family consists of 230 bird species within 50 genera, and members occur on every continent besides Antarctica. It includes birds like: There are several recognized subspecies, which include: The linnet has a gray head, as well as gray underparts. Their chins and throats are a lighter, whitish color. Linnets’ upper breasts are a vibrant red, which flows into a brown color on their bellies. In addition, the center of their breasts and upper bellies are pink or buff. Finally, their wings are a mixture of brown, white, and black. The males change color slightly during mating season, with brown upperparts, dull red underparts, and black tails, ending in a buff color. The top of their wings are usually chestnut brown; the coverts on the outer parts of their wings are black and narrow. However, their primary coverts are white, and the secondary and tertiary coverts are brown. Linnets crowns have a red spot on the front, which is their most significant distinguishing feature. They have black bills with a gray base and dark brown eyes. In addition, their feet and legs are light brown. One distinguishing feature between genders is the male’s pinkish-red forehead and chest, which is absent in females. On Average, linnets measure 5 inches in length and weigh 0.5 to 0.75 ounces, with a wingspan of 8.5 to 10 inches. Linnets are omnivores and primarily feed on plant matter, but they also enjoy seeds, fruit, and buds. Chicks mainly feed on seeds, including kernels from: Adult linnets spend a lot of their time on the ground foraging and will also prey on invertebrates and larval insects. The Northern and Eastern populations of linnets start to migrate south during autumn. The male’s coloring starts to change to a bright rose-pink color when they migrate back north after wintering in North Africa and Europe. Linnets spend most of their time on the ground foraging and hopping around in the low vegetation. However, unlike most finches, they do not hang upside down. They usually live in pairs or small colonies; however, outside of the mating season, they will form larger flocks consisting of hundreds of birds. In addition, they will forage with mixed-specie flocks in semi-desert, along coastlines, and in open cultivated fields. While linnets are monogamous during mating season, they do not mate for life. While breeding pairs are together, the males are highly territorial and will defend the nesting site and the surrounding area. During courtship displays, males ruffle their crown and breast feathers, enhancing their crimson-colored patches. They also hop around the female while singing, drop their wings, and fan their tails while slightly swaying from side to side. Sometimes the males will chase the females while flying erratically through low vegetation. In addition, the pair will touch bills to show affection, and the males will feed the females during courtship and incubation. Linnets’ breeding season takes place between mid-April and early August. In addition, linnets produce two to three broods annually. The females are responsible for building nests, but while they collect the material, the males accompany them to stand guard. Females construct their nests relatively low, usually about 9 feet above ground in hedges, thorny, dense bushes, and sometimes in woodpiles. Linnets build their nests in the shape of a cup with moss, roots, twigs, and plant fibers. In addition, they line the nest with fur, plant down, and feathers. Female linnets lay between 4 to 6 light blue eggs with dark streaking and spots. They incubate their eggs alone for 11 to 13 days while males do the hunting. Males and females share the responsibility of caring for the chicks who remain in the nest for 10 to 14 days. However, once the chicks have fledged, they still rely on their parents for two more weeks. Linnets’ breeding success rate depends on a few factors like predation from mammals and other birds, weather conditions, and human threats. These birds have a relatively short lifespan; on average, they can live for 2 years in their natural habitats . However, there are records of linnets living up to 8 years in the wild. The linnet needs to be wary of birds of prey like hawks and eagles who prey on them. In the late 20 th century, linnet populations over much of north-west and central Europe declined due to the growth of the agricultural sector. This resulted in hedgerows’ destruction and fallow weedy fields’ eradication because of herbicide applications. Linnet’s conservation status is listed as Least Concern on IUCN’s redlist . However, their population is on the decline, and various organizations are going to great efforts to save them from extinction. Linnets have an estimated population size of between 50 to 100 million individuals. While this seems like a large number, their population is decreasing yearly. Linnets are boisterous birds that make very loud noises. They use ‘chit-chit-chit’ calls to communicate and express themselves. In addition, they sing while in flight with other finch species and when they rest on tree branches. Several types of birds are very similar to linnets, either in size, color, or behavior. These species include: The lesser redpoll is a small bird specie that spends a lot of its time foraging for seeds and invertebrates in tall trees like birch, larch, and alder. Initially, they were classified as the Common Redpoll, but data suggests they are their own species and were renamed the lesser redpoll. They often flock with Siskins and have recently started frequenting bird feeders in urban gardens. Breeding occurs in woodlands or gardens, where they can be seen dangling from tiny twigs in alder or birch trees or, alternatively, from shrub stems. They are a widespread species and occur across Scotland, Wales, and northern and eastern England. Lesser redpolls will migrate in small flocks from their breeding territories to lowland areas when temperatures start to decrease. They favor the stands of Ash and Birch trees, where they can use their slender bills to extract seeds. Lesser redpolls frequent suburban bird feeders, especially in the colder months when their food supply runs low. They typically feed on seeds, especially conifer seeds. However, to get to tricky spots, the lesser redpoll will hang upside down while gripping onto branches with its strong feet. In addition, they eat fruit, buds, and invertebrates. During the winter months, flocks tend to favor birch and alder trees. This species is rare in central, southern, and southwest England. However, they do sometimes inhabit these areas in winter. Common redpolls are small greyish-brown finches with bright red patches and darks streaking on their forehead. In addition, they have a black bib and two pale stripes running down their wings. They primarily feed on seeds and often eat acrobatically (upside down). However, they also enjoy vegetable matter, catkins, willow buds, birches, alders, smaller conifer seeds, and the seeds of grass and weeds. In addition, they eat insects , typically during summer. Redpolls can temporarily store seeds in their throat pouches. This helps them hold their food and fly away before eating it to avoid predators or seek a warmer location. Common redpolls prefer to inhabit open thickets, brushy pastures, and weedy fields. Breeding takes place in conifer plantations, usually in upland areas. Common redpolls generally have two clutches per year. Females will incubate the for around 10 to 11 days, while males do all the hunting and foraging. Chicks start to fledge by 12 days old and rely on their parents for a few weeks afterward. When the temperature drops, some common redpolls will tunnel into the snow for warmth during the night. These tunnels can measure more than a foot underneath the insulating snow. The twite is a small finch often found around salt marshes. They migrate south during the colder months and return to their native habitat with the arrival of summer. Twites are often confused with members of the linnet family, even though they have a lot of differences, the main one being the color of their feathers. These birds inhabit Scotland’s highlands and England and Wales’s northern territories. However, they cover most of Europe during migratory seasons, and can also be found in Asia , specifically, China. Twites are mainly spotted on the coast and moorland in areas without trees. In addition, they occur near shareas with dense shrubbery and salt marshes. Unlike most finches, both sexes help to collect material and build nests. Although there is no evidence of their lifespans, finches are known to live between 5 to 20 years in the wild. These tiny birds can lay between 5 to 6 eggs during the breeding season, which begins in May each year. Their eggs are a magnificent pale blue color.",

    "Name": "Narwhal",
    "Features": "Prominent tusk",
    "Text": "Narwhals are animals that roam the cold waters of the Arctic Ocean and Northern Atlantic in search of prey. They sometimes surface for oxygen in larger groups, allowing tourists and any other passerby to take in a captivating spectacle. Humans have traditionally hunted them for their immense resources, but this species is not yet in danger of extinction. The scientific name of the narwhal is Monodon monoceros. This derives from a Greek word meaning one tooth, one horn. This species is the only currently living member of the genus. Thus, the term narwhal can technically refer to either the species or the genus. It also belongs to the family of Monodontidae. The only other living member of the family is the beluga whale. More distantly, it is related to all other whales, dolphins , and cetaceans. The narwhal is an animal that basically resembles a small whale. It is only small compared to other cetaceans, however. By any other standard, the narwhal is actually a large marine mammal with a body size of 13 to 20 feet and a tusk size of around 10 feet. It also weighs a truly imposing 1.5 tons. This makes it nearly the length of a bus and the weight of a car. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The narwhal is characterized by a prominent tusk on its skull, upturned flippers, and a dorsal ridge instead of a true fin on the back. Each dorsal ridge is entirely unique to the individual, which helps scientists identify them at a glance. Narwhals change color throughout their lifetimes. They start with a dark blue or gray color at birth and then adopt a whiter mottled pattern around their stomach and sides as they age. Some older narwhals are almost entirely white in appearance. With a thick layer of blubber, the narwhal is highly adapted for life in the frigid waters of the north. Its physical characteristics, including the ability to lactate, attest to the fact that the narwhal is purely a mammal. Specialized hemoglobin in the blood allows it to remain submerged for very long periods of time, but it does need to surface occasionally to draw in oxygen from the air. The narwhale lives and travels in large pods of up to 20 or 25 individuals, though some pods may contain only a few narwhals. During migration season, these pods merge up to form a group of hundreds or even thousands of individuals. Once they reach their destination, the pods then break up into their smaller groups and go their separate ways. Other aspects of their social lives are not understood very well. The groups appear to have no specific organization in regard to age, sex, or familial relations, so it is not entirely clear how they form. They communicate with others and gather information about their environment, including the location of prey, through various whistles, clicks, and knocks created by the movement of air between chambers near the blow hole. The narwhal’s ivory spiral tusk is a truly impressive instrument. With almost 10 million nerve endings, it is an excellent sensory organ that can gather information about water pressure, temperature, and salinity. This horn actually develops from a large tooth and then protrudes through the upper lip of the skull to the left, giving it the appearance of a unicorn. Interestingly, the narwhal has two teeth. In most individuals, the second tooth usually remains undeveloped, but in very rare cases it has been known to grow into a second tusk from its skull. The purpose of the tusk is not yet known. However, scientists have surmised that it might play an important role in the narwhal’s mating ritual. Narwhals also engage in a practice known as tusking in which one bull rubs its tusk against another bull. This may be related to either social dominance or the communication of sensory information. It is unlikely to be involved in food gathering or defense because the male tusk is so much larger than the female tusk. As perhaps the northernmost cetacean species in the world, the narwhale inhabits the cold waters of Canada, Greenland, Russia, and Norway. It migrates around the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans every year, preferring the ice-free coastal waters in the summer and the deeper icy waters in the winter. The narwhal lives at different depths depending on what it’s doing. When hunting, it can dive nearly 3,000 feet beneath the water in search of food. But when migrating, it prefers to remain near shallower parts of the water. The evolutionary history of the narwhal is one that has been full of surprises and puzzles for the scientists studying them. One of the most baffling aspects of these creatures is their large distinct horn. For many years, biologists believed it to be a tusk similar to that of an elephant or walrus, but further study revealed it was actually closer to a canine tooth! Another reason why narwhals have confused science is their relatively prosperous populations despite showing extremely low genetic diversity. Low genetic diversity is typically attributed to inbreeding in a species or populations that are reaching their demise. In the narwhal’s case, it is believed that it is more likely that around the time of the first ice age, the narwhal’s earliest ancient relatives suddenly found themselves in an environment where they were best suited to survival and those same genes present then underwent little to no change out of a lack of necessity. The narwhal has a rather specialized diet consisting of squid, shrimp , cod, halibut, and other species of fish. The diet varies greatly by the seasons. In the summer, it may barely eat at all, instead relying on fat stores. Because of its mass and the freezing conditions of its environment, the narwhal has only a few natural predators in the wild such as orcas , sharks, and humans . Occasionally it has been preyed upon by polar bears and walruses , which have been known to kill narwhals when they are caught in a compromised position with restricted movement in shallow ice pools. In order to avoid falling prey, the narwhal seeks solace and protection in larger groups. Adults are able to put up a tough fight, so predators are more likely to target young, sick, and elderly individuals. The coloration also offers a degree of camouflage. When the narwhale is seen from below, the white stomach blends in with the shallower water. When seen from above, the dark back blends in with the deeper water below. The narwhal has been hunted by the Inuit for many thousands of years. Almost every part of the narwhal is used. The blubber and oil are good for lighting and cooking. The meat provides an excellent source of vitamin C that is otherwise difficult to obtain in the Arctic. And the tusks are used to fashion spears and harpoons. The practice is still maintained in many parts of the Arctic. Industrial-scale hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries did not threaten the narwhal to quite the same extent as many other species of whales, but it did cause numbers to decline from their peak. Hunting is not the only threat, however. The narwhal also faces risks from pollution (particularly metal contamination) and climate change. As the oceans warm, it not only threatens the narwhal’s natural habitat, but it also opens up the oceans to more human activity such as oil exploitation and shipping. Due to the difficulty of observing this species, the reproduction cycle of the narwhal is poorly understood. Based on limited data, it is believed that dominant males may have multiple female partners during the breeding season between March and May. As mentioned previously, the male tusk may serve the dual purpose of attracting mates and battling rivals. After a 14-month gestation period, the female narwhale produces one or two children in the following summer. These young calves are born tail first and are expected to begin swimming immediately from the womb. Over the next 20 months, the calf will receive protection and care and learn valuable social and survival skills from the mother and the group. It is not entirely clear what kind of role the father has in raising the calf. Because the males and females tend to travel together as a group, it is thought that the father does have some investment in his young. Narwhals have a very long and robust life expectancy. It is estimated that they can live up to 50 years in the wild. The age of sexual maturity is not quite known, but it is likely to take up to nine years for males. The female conceives every two to three years on average, which ensures a constant supply of new calves. According to the IUCN Red List , which tracks data about the conservation status of different species in the wild, there are approximately 123,000 mature narwhal individuals left in the entire world. The IUCN lists it as a species of least concern, which means it requires no special conservation efforts to improve population numbers, but other organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund consider it to be near threatened. Looming threats such as climate change could cause population numbers to decline in the future.",

    "Name": "Bearded Dragon",
    "Text": "“A bearded dragon can change the color of its beard according to its mood” Bearded dragons live in Central and Southern Australia. See all of our expert product reviews . They are omnivores that can live to be 15 years or older. This animal uses the beard of spines under its chin to communicate its moods to other animals. A bearded dragon is cold-blooded, so it needs to live in warm temperatures. This reptile is a popular pet because it’s affectionate and curious. Learn about the most friendly wild animals in the world here . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . • A bearded dragon can grow to be 2 feet long • Some bearded dragons go into a type of hibernation in cold weather • Bearded dragons live in woodlands, deserts, and savannas • These reptiles lay on rocks to sun themselves and raise their body temperature Bearded dragons are a type of lizard that originated from the common reptilian trunk about 250 million years ago. This branch of ancient reptilians is actually much older than the branch that would eventually lead to the dinosaurs and birds. See all of our expert product reviews . In fact, One ancestor, Pogona barbata , had a lot of yellow pigment in its mouth so any Pogona today with the same characteristic has at least some P. barbata bloodline. These days, Bearded dragons are now found in many deserts and other dry climates in Australia. The bearded dragon is this reptile’s common name while its scientific name is Pogona Vitticeps. Look a little further into the taxonomy of this reptile and you’ll see it belongs to the Agamidae family and its classification is Reptilia. The scientific name of this animal comes from the Greek words Pogona (Pogon) meaning beard and Vitticeps meaning striped beard. Central Bearded Dragon: The central bearded dragon ( Pogona vitticeps ) is also known as the inland bearded dragon. It is also the most common species found as a pet. Eastern Bearded Dragon: The eastern bearded dragon ( Pogona barbata ), also known as the common bearded dragon or simply bearded lizard. Despite being a member of the toxic-bearing species, they are non-venomous however, they can bite. Rankin’s Dragon Pogona Minor Dragon: Rankin’s dragon ( Pogona henrylawsoni ) is a species of Australian agamid lizard. It may also be called the pygmy bearded dragon. They are a smaller cousin of the common bearded dragon and are just as friendly. Pogona Minor Dragon: Pogona minor minima, the Abrolhos bearded dragon or Abrolhos dwarf bearded dragon, is an agamid lizard. They produce relatively large clutches of eggs (about 30 eggs at once!) A bearded dragon has yellowish, tan skin. It has a long body with a tail measuring more than half of its total length. A bearded dragon can measure up to 2 feet in length including its tail. An adult bearded dragon can weigh up to 18 ounces. Grab 2 cans of soup from your kitchen pantry and imagine that a bearded dragon’s weight is equal to about a can and a half. This reptile has spines under its chin and along the sides of its body. Also, it has ear holes on the sides of its triangular head. A bearded dragon has four sturdy legs and sharp claws that help it to climb trees. A bearded dragon protects itself from predators by changing color and blending into its environment. Plus, its scales and spiny skin help to protect it when a predator like a snake or a hawk tries to grab it. When this animal feels threatened, it puffs up its spiny beard and opens its mouth to make itself appear larger to enemies. Bearded dragons are shy, solitary animals except during mating season. They can be aggressive only when they feel their territory is being threatened. Also, males can be aggressive while choosing a mate. The spiny beard of a bearded dragon helps it to communicate in many ways. When this reptile changes the color of its beard and quickly bobs its head it is trying to show dominance over another male. When a bearded dragon bobs its head slowly and raises one of its legs, it is showing that it’s not a threat to another dragon in the area. There are 8 species of bearded dragons that live across the continent of Australia . They live in arid and subtropical environments including savannas, woodlands, and deserts. Lots of bearded dragons climb into trees and sit on branches to sun themselves. Being up so high allows them to be on the lookout for predators in the area. Plus, they can change skin color blending in with the branch they’re sitting on. Other bearded dragons sun themselves on rocks. If this reptile sees a predator while sunning itself on a rock, it scurries into a crack between rocks to hide underground. When the cold weather season starts in the autumn, bearded dragons go into a type of hibernation called brumation. While in brumation, this reptile is not completely asleep like a bear would be. The difference is it doesn’t eat during this period but does drink water to stay hydrated. Bearded dragons are omnivores. They are not picky about their diet. They eat insects such as cockroaches , crickets, and locusts . In addition, they will snack on flowers, fruit, and leaves. Some bearded dragons eat lizards and small rodents such as mice . These reptiles eat about once a day. If an adult bearded dragon is hunting crickets, it may eat 2 or 3 large ones. A baby bearded dragon that is growing quickly is likely to eat more than an adult reptile. Fireflies and other insects that glow in the dark are poisonous to bearded iguanas . The chemical in a firefly’s body that makes it glow is harmful to a bearded dragon. In addition, bearded dragons do eat fruit, however, avocados are poisonous to them. For a complete list of foods bearded dragons eat, check out our “ What Do Bearded Dragons Eat? ” page. Snakes , birds, dingoes , goannas, and crocodiles are all predators of a bearded dragon. An owl may fly down to a branch to grab a bearded dragon that’s sunning itself. Or, a dingo may capture a bearded dragon that’s lying on a rock to get some sun in the afternoon. Though a bearded dragon can run up to 9 miles an hour, it isn’t as fast as some of its predators. The habitat of bearded dragons is threatened. When trees are cut down or land cleared, bearded dragons have no place to live. Also, some bearded dragons are caught and sold as exotic pets in other countries. This reduces the population in the wild. Fortunately, there are preserves in Australia where bearded dragons are cared for and protected from both of these threats. Their official conservation status is Least Concern . Bearded dragons mate in the spring and summertime. During mating season, a male bearded dragon bobs its head and stamps its feet to attract a female. A female can lay from 11 to 30 eggs at a time. After mating with one male, a female may lay two or three different groups of eggs that number 11 to 30. A female bearded dragon may lay 9 groups or clutches of eggs in one year. The gestation period of this reptile is 55 to 75 days. This is a lot shorter than an iguana’s which is 90 to 120 days. It’s possible for the sex of a bearded dragon to change while it’s incubating. A developing male can develop into a female bearded dragon if the temperature during incubation is especially hot. It takes about three days for a baby bearded dragon to break out of its egg. Its birth weight is around one ounce and it’ll be about 3 to 4 inches long. A baby bearded dragon that is 4 inches in length is just a little longer than a crayon. Baby bearded dragons are sometimes called hatchlings. Once a female bearded dragon lays her eggs, she doesn’t see them again. They are on their own immediately after they hatch. Bearded dragons live for about 15 years. Pet bearded dragons may live a little longer because of the lack of threat from predators. These reptiles are sometimes vulnerable to respiratory infections and parasites but otherwise live healthy lives if they take in enough nutrition. The oldest bearded dragon is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. This bearded dragon named Sebastian lived to be 18 years old. He died in 2016 in England. There are several key differences between male and female bearded dragons , Males are typically about 20% larger in terms of weight. Most importantly, male bearded dragons will have two hemipenal bulges. There is where the sex organs of male bearded dragons are kept. In females, there will be a single bulge that’s centered on their bodies. The official conservation status of the bearded dragon is Least Concern. The population of these reptiles remains steady in Australia. Plus, there are over 900 bearded dragons living in zoos throughout the world. There are laws in Australia protecting bearded dragons from poachers who capture them and try to ship them out of the country. Today, many bearded dragons are bred outside of Australia. Bearded dragons are one of the more popular choices for pet lizards . In captivity, they generally grow up to 24″ long and live 10 years on average. When young, they eat an even mix of plants and insects, and as they mature their diet goes heavily plant-based, with only about 10% insects. A terrarium of a minimum of 40 gallons would be needed to create a good habitat for your pet, and factors to take into account would include: heating, substrate, lighting, humidity, temperature, and decor.",

    "Name": "Blue Ringed Octopus",
    "Features": "The glowing blue rings on the yellow skin",
    "Text": "The blue-ringed octopus is a tiny marine animal that is agile, intelligent, and even a bit beautiful, but also remarkably deadly. The blue-ringed octopus is a genus of highly toxic cephalopods which lurk off the coasts around the Pacific and Indian Oceans . There are currently four recognized species in this genus: the greater blue-ringed octopus, the southern blue-ringed octopus, and the blue-lined octopus. A fourth species is only known from a single specimen, and there may be more species not yet properly documented in the wild. Their venom is one thousand times more deadly than cyanide, making it one of the most dangerous animals in the world. There is currently no known antivenom for someone who has endured a bite, but fortunately, deaths are exceptionally rare. Given their small size, these are very effective predators. This octopus is part of the cephalopod family, which is an ancient species that dates back even further than sharks and dinosaurs. They first evolved during the Cambrian period, around 530 million years ago, from a mollusk-type organism where the shell became altered to a buoyancy device with chambers. They further diverged during the Paleozoic era, around 416 million years ago, into the shape we see today. The blue-ringed octopus, unlike others of the cephalopod species, developed lethal adaptations as well as its characteristic blue rings, although they lost their defensive ability to ink as their ink sacs grew smaller. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The scientific name for the blue-ringed octopus is Hapalochlaena. This comes from the combination of two different Greek words: hapalo, meaning delicate, and chlaena, meaning a type of cloak. They belong to the most common family of octopuses in the world, Octopodidae. Although there may be around 10 different species of blue-ringed octopuses, there are only 4 species that have been given names. These 4 are: The blue-ringed octopus is a small animal, measuring no more than 10 inches when fully extended. It is characterized by yellow-colored skin with up to 25 bright blue rings located around the body. Like all octopuses, their body plan is composed of a large central cavity, called a mantle, and eight arms extending from it; the beak and mouth sit at the entrance of the mantle, where the tentacles meet. The body itself is composed entirely of soft tissue. It does not have a skeletal structure (though it does have a skull to protect its brain). This enables the octopus to contort and contract its body in almost every possible way so it can squeeze into narrow crevices and holes where most other marine animals of their size could not fit. Octopuses are remarkably effective escape artists. It’s often been said that the octopus represents what we might expect alien life to look like. It offers a strange glimpse into how intelligence has evolved into a form of life completely different from our own. Their unique intelligence has given rise to all sorts of complex and fascinating behavior, but curiously, a social system is not among them. These are solitary animals that do all of their feeding and sleeping alone. The only time they come into contact with other members of the same species is when they want to mate. Octopuses owe their amazing motor skills to the presence of around 500 million neurons, about the same as a dog . But unlike vertebrates, around two-thirds of these neurons are located in the arms and body instead of the brain. The arms can be used to grasp objects, provide tactile feedback, solve problems, and taste and smell their surroundings. While they’re not quite (as some suggest) truly functional minds of their own, there appears to be a complex exchange of information between the arms and the brain that facilitates the movement, so each one can act independently from the other. The arms are truly some of the most exquisitely sensitive instruments in the animal kingdom. Like many other types of octopuses, this genus has the amazing ability to change color in a flash thanks to the presence of specialized skin cells. Camouflage obviously serves as an important function to hide it from the prying eyes of predators, but the octopus can also change its colors to convey mood. When it feels threatened, the octopus will turn bright yellow and flash its blue rings as a warning to potential predators. They can control these pigments by contracting their muscles in specific ways. In order to immobilize prey and neutralize predators, the octopus deploys a mixture of several highly potent venoms. Some of these venoms are found in other cephalopods as well, but this species also houses a dangerous neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin. This is the same deadly substance found in pufferfish . Its potency comes from live bacteria stored inside salivary glands. How this symbiotic relationship between the octopus and bacteria arose as one of its adaptations is the subject of some scientific studies. Once it enters the body (either via a bite or an opening), the toxin blocks nerve signals that control the muscles. The symptoms of its venom, at least in humans, include numbness, paralysis, nausea, loss of motor skills, and vision loss or blindness. Survival depends on how quickly one can obtain medical attention because people can die in as little as 30 minutes from the moment of the bite. Since the venom affects one’s ability to draw in oxygen, the victim has to be put on a ventilator in order to survive, but the long-term prognosis is usually excellent. Curiously, the victim remains completely conscious throughout the entire ordeal. Only the actual motor system is affected. While even a small fraction of its venom is deadly enough to kill a person, there haven’t actually been any recorded deaths since 1960 despite the lack of any known anti-venom. These are generally shy, non-aggressive creatures that would rather flee than fight. They will only bite if they feel directly threatened. Nevertheless, people should not touch or handle them under any circumstances. This octopus can be found lingering in the sandy bottoms of shallow tide pools and rocky coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Its normal locations range between India , Japan , Australia , and the Philippines . Wary of danger, it spends most of the day hiding in crevices, shells, or debris. The only time it comes out is to feed and mate. Despite its potent venom, the blue-ringed octopus is small, fragile, and wary of predators. Though not currently targeted by the fishing industry, it is sometimes captured for the aquarium trade. Coastal development and marine pollution may also affect them in ways that are as of yet not fully understood. This octopus is preyed upon by seals , large fish, water birds, and moray eels . If the camouflage or the hiding space fails, then obviously its greatest defensive adaptations against predators are the highly potent toxins. Even consuming this octopus without being bitten is no guarantee against its poison. For this reason, many predators learn quickly to stay away. Its diet consists mostly of hard-shelled crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs . It may also feed on small fish when the opportunity arises. It will either immobilize its prey by piercing the body with a bite from its sharp beak, or it will release a large cloud of venom into the water, which will enter the prey’s body through the gills. The tentacles will draw the prey in toward the beak. Reproduction for this octopus begins with a mating ritual in which the male caresses the female’s body with his tentacles. Once he has established contact, he will grab her body and insert one of his specialized arms (which stores and transfers sperm) into her mantle. Studies have shown that the female can temporarily store sperm (and even choose which of the male’s sperm to fertilize with) until she is ready to lay her eggs. It’s thought that this octopus may mate with multiple partners within a short span of time. The female seems to show a preference for larger males, but the male does not seem to show any preference at all. He will mate with just about any other member of the species, regardless of size or sex. This is implied by the frequent number of male-on-male mounting incidences observed in the wild. After she’s been fertilized, the female will lay only a single clutch of 50 eggs in her lifetime, normally around the fall season. She will guard the nest with absolute determination for the next several months until the eggs are ready to hatch. Since she does not even leave the nest to feed, the process will greatly weaken her, and she will die a short time later. Males usually die shortly after mating as well. The young larvae develop quickly and reach full sexual maturity within a year. Like many species of octopus, it has a very short lifespan of only about two years. This gives them just enough time to reproduce once before expiring. Since this octopus is so shy and elusive (and spread out across a wide area), the population size is currently unknown. Three of the four species are classified by the IUCN Red List as species of least concern . The other species (for which only a single specimen is known) is listed as data deficient . Not many facts are known about it.",

    "Name": "Jacksons Chameleon",
    "Features": "Three horns",
    "Text": "Despite the small size of the dwarf Jackson’s chameleon, it still has the three horns that the species is known for. Also known as the Kikuyu three-horned chameleon, the Jackson’s chameleon is most commonly known for the three horns that adorn its face. Though it isn’t known for being the largest or smallest of any type of animal, it is one of the few reptiles that experience a live birth (though the hatchlings are kept as eggs within the female for several months). The bright green hue of the male Jackson’s chameleon is quite easy to spot, which is why many people choose to care for it as a pet. Here are a few interesting facts about Jackson’s chameleons: The scientific name of the Jackson’s chameleon is Trioceros jacksonii. Though there are no other names for this reptile, it belongs to the Chamaeleonidae family in the Reptilia class. There are only three subspecies of Jackson’s chameleons, which include the: The word “ Trioceros ” comes from two Greek words – the prefix τρί- (tri-) and κέρας (kéras). While “tri-” means “three,” “kéras” means horns, which is a clear description of one of the most notable features. “ jacksonii, ” on the other hand, is a Latinized variation of ornithologist Frederick John Johnson’s last name. At the time, this scientist was the first Governor of Kenya . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The evolutionary history of the Jackson’s chameleon is a fascinating topic that has intrigued scientists and researchers for many years. This species, which is native to East Africa , has undergone several significant changes over time. One of the most interesting aspects of the Jackson’s chameleon’s evolution is its ability to change color. This adaptation allows it to blend in with its surroundings and avoid predators. Through genetic mutations and natural selection, this trait evolved over time to become more refined and effective. In terms of fossil evidence, there are limited findings related specifically to the Jackson’s chameleon. However, studies have shown that similar species existed as far back as 26 million years ago during the Oligocene period. These ancient relatives were found in Europe and North America. Overall, while there may not be extensive fossil evidence directly related to the Jackson’s chameleon itself, it is clear that this species has undergone a remarkable journey throughout its evolutionary history. One of the most notable features of Jackson’s chameleons is the bright green hue, which is more common among males. To accent their vibrant color, they also have blue and yellow markings around their face and feet. The female, on the other hand, is not quite as vibrant. The easiest way to tell the difference between the female and male Jackson’s chameleon is the horned face. Only the males have the three horns that this reptile is known for. This horned look is typically used to defend the territory of the male, much like the purpose of the horned (but extinct) triceratops. Even the rhinoceros only have 1-2 horns, though some may have three. On average, these reptiles can weigh up to 150 grams when they reach their full size, which is slightly more than a baseball. They are about 9-13 inches long. Males are often larger than their female counterparts, but the yellow-crested Jackson’s chameleon can grow to be 15 inches long. The dwarf Jackson’s chameleon is typically much smaller. The grouping structure of this reptile is rather unique. If kept as a pet or even in the wild, one of these reptiles is content to roam, hunt, and live alone. They come at a price of $75 to $175 in stores. However, within a family unit, the organization is much different. With their social structure, they have the freedom to keep space from each other when they want to have it, allowing them to consistently communicate. They require special care to keep them happy and healthy when in captivity, and they must be allowed to become comfortable before their personality shines. It is not advised to keep these types of chameleons in a tank together, as they will often fight over the food, space, and where they like to bask in the light. This pairing can lead to severe injuries or fatalities. The only time that these reptiles typically become aggressive is when their freedom to live as they’d like is impeded, including their access to food and water. On their own, the Jackson’s chameleon can be quite even-tempered, though they lean more towards a shy personality. They are much less timid than other wild animals, making them easy to keep as pets. They are typically active during the day and will enjoy the sunlight between hunting sessions. The first Jackson’s chameleons were found in Kenya and Tanzania , and two of their subspecies are still found broadly throughout the area. By the early 1970s, they became an invasive species in Hawaii as well, allowing them to spread their population rapidly. Even though it is only found in the wild in Hawaii, Tanzania, and Kenya, they still have thrived. In the wild, these reptiles prefer to live in woodlands and forests, typically finding a home at altitudes of no less than 1,600 meters. Some will travel as high as 2,440 meters in Kenya and Tanzania, allowing them to reach the sunlight when temperatures reach about 16–27 °C (61–81 °F) during the daytime. In some cases, the reptile is found in wooded areas in the suburbs of Nairobi. The Jackson’s chameleons that live in Hawaii find themselves at altitudes of 100 to 1,000 meters. Instead of inhabiting wet and shaded areas. Jackson’s chameleons are mostly insectivores, and their diet consists of a variety of insects, such as spiders and flies. In the wild, they primarily feed on crickets, grasshoppers, flies, moths, and other small invertebrates that they can find crawling or flying around their habitat. They will eat the leaves of plants such as ficus and hibiscus only rarely. Jackson’s chameleons rely heavily on their eyesight to locate prey. Their eyes move independently from each other, allowing them to scan for food in different directions at once. Once they spot a potential meal, they use their long tongue to snatch it up quickly with lightning-fast reflexes. Although Jackson’s chameleons are not active hunters like some predators that stalk their prey before attacking them. However, they do have a hunting strategy known as ambush hunting. Remaining still for extended periods while waiting for unsuspecting prey to come within striking distance allows them to conserve energy while maximizing the chances of catching something nutritious. In captivity, where food is readily available but may not be nutritionally balanced, provide appropriate supplementation, such as calcium-dusted insects. As always, seek advice from a veterinarian before giving supplements to your pet. As solitary as the Jackson’s chameleon can be, it still has its share of predators. Due to their slow speed, they are rather easy to catch. However, their horns allow them to put up quite a fight. Since they are protected from illegal sales in most regions, there is little threat from humans. This reptile is up against many predators, and its slow speed does not help with its defense at all. Animals that eat the Jackson’s chameleon while they are young include some species of spiders, birds , snakes , and adult chameleons of other species. The adults are hunted by snakes, monkeys , parasites, birds, and shrews as well. Jackson’s chameleons have a rather broad diet of insects, including crickets, silkworms, roaches , mealworms, grasshoppers , and fruit flies. Mating between the female and male Jackson’s chameleon is unique. The only time that these reptiles tend to come together is to mate, communicating through a series of physical gestures. The male will use head bobbing, though he’ll also flex his neck and show his open mouth. The female, in response, will show her acceptance of these movements by becoming bright green along her scales. This communication has been praised by scientists as a way to show the intelligence of the species. Typically, this mating can result in 8-30 eggs (though it can be up to 40 in larger litters), which are kept within the female’s body for about three months. They have a live birth, though there are recorded instances of being born within a soft membrane. Females often reproduce seasonally, which means that a new litter is born every 6 months. The young are typically 52-55 mm long at birth, though about half of their size is their tail. Rather than being green or blue, the young are black, white, and grey. There is no weaning period, and the young can catch live prey from birth. It only takes about 5 or 6 months after birth for these chameleons to reach sexual maturity. The current population of Jackson’s chameleons is unknown, but they are a threatened species due to several factors. One major threat to their existence is habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human activities such as deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization. This has resulted in the destruction of their natural habitats, which makes them vulnerable to predators and other threats. Another significant threat facing Jackson’s chameleons is the introduction of non-native predators like rats and cats into their ecosystems. These invasive species prey on young or adult chameleons, reducing their numbers significantly. Additionally, illegal collection for the pet trade has also led to declining populations. Conservation efforts have been put in place to protect these unique creatures from extinction. Some measures include setting up protected areas where they can thrive without disturbance from humans or introduced predators; implementing strict laws against poaching and trading; educating local communities on the importance of preserving endangered species like Jackson’s chameleon; and conducting research aimed at improving our understanding of these animals’ biology, behavior patterns, distribution range among others. Overall, there is still much work needed towards conserving this iconic reptile so that future generations can enjoy its beauty as well as preserve biodiversity in our ecosystems.",

    "Name": "Green Tree Frog",
    "Features": "They’re amphibians, but they live in trees",
    "Text": "“Three different amphibians are called Green Tree Frog!” Among the more than 800 tree frog species in the world, three share the moniker “green tree frog.” The Australian green tree frog measures approximately 4 inches long, and its back is a bright jade green, while the American green tree frog measures approximately 2.5 inches long, and its back is more olive green. Emerald tree frogs are 2.5 inches long and live in Tawain. All three species are popular terrarium inhabitants. In fact, Australian green tree frogs, first introduced as pets, can now be found in the wild throughout many parts of Florida, which makes these naming conventions all the more confusing. American green tree frogs are the official state amphibian of Louisiana and Georgia. The Australian native’s scientific name is Litoria caerulea . “Litoria” is the name given to the genus of tree frogs native to Australia and nearby locations such as New Guinea , the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands . While species in this genus vary widely in appearance, they all share unpigmented eyelids and horizontal irises. “Caerula” is Latin for “blue” and refers to the fact that this frog owes its striking emerald coloration to blue pigments that overlie a base coat of yellow. The American native’s scientific name is Hyla cinerea . “Hyla” is the name of a genus in the tree frog family “Hylidae” and was inspired by the mythological hero Hylas, a companion of Heracles; “Cinereus,” which is Latin for grey, refers to the olive tinge of this amphibian’s skin. The green tree frog native to Tawain has the scientific name Zhangixalus prasinatus. It belongs to the order Anura and the family Rhacophoridae. it is also called the tributary flying frog and the Tawainese green treefrog. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . There are approximately 800 different species of tree frogs, but only three of them are commonly referred to as ‘green tree frogs.’ We do know something about the evolutionary history of the green tree frog. The species is believed to have evolved from a common ancestor in South America over 10 million years ago. This ancestor was likely a terrestrial animal that adapted to become an arboreal creature, which explains why modern-day green tree frogs are so adept at climbing and jumping from branch to branch. Over time, these animals spread out across Central America and into North America, where they could be found living in trees close to bodies of water. Today, this species inhabits parts of Mexico as well as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Louisiana in the United States. It has also been introduced into New Zealand and Hawaii with varying levels of success. Each species has a chameleon-like ability to change color depending on temperature, lighting conditions, and the animals’ general surroundings. Much of the time, the Australian animal is a bright jade green, while the American animal is a less vivid, greyer green. These colors reflect the hues of the leaves and other vegetation where the animal typically lives. The Australian frog is larger than its American counterpart. Its belly is white; its limbs are short and strong and end in digits that are specialized for sticking to surfaces like trees. During mating season, males grow a black pad on their proximal digit so that they can better grasp the female during amplexus. Beneath its throat, the Australian native has a large vocal sac that’s grey in males and white in females. When fully grown, females are slightly larger than males. The limbs of the American green tree frog end in long, thin digits tipped with sticky spatulate pads. While the Oz native almost appears to grasp the branch upon which it is sticking, the American native merely sticks to it. The green tree frog found in the U.S. also has a white or cream-colored lateral stripe running from its jaw to its groin. Frogs are social animals that live in groups. A group of frogs is called either an army or a chorus. The latter designation reflects the fact that these little amphibians are enthusiastic vocalizers, especially after a rain shower. Their distinctive croaks play an important role in their mating rituals but also serve as a warning when a predator grows too near. Both of these frog species are largely nocturnal. During the day, they like to tunnel into cooler, moister, darker areas from which they emerge as the sun sets, ready to feed and croak. Each of these frog species is a popular terrarium pet. While the Australian green tree frog is a brash little fellow with relatively little fear of humans, its American counterpart is timid and does not tolerate frequent handling. Australian green tree frogs are found in a variety of habitats that range from relatively dry eucalyptus stands in the northwest parts of Australia to the more tropical forests of New Guinea . Though frogs have lungs, much of their oxygen exchange occurs through skin absorption, so their skin must remain moist. Some scientists speculate that the Australian species has a bioregulation mechanism that actually allows it to control the amount of water that evaporates through its skin. Thus, it is able to thrive in seasonally dry and wet habitats. Australian frogs also appear to have some kind of homing ability that allows them to return to the spot they were captured from, even if they were released a fair distance away. American frogs are most frequently found in trees near lakes, marshes, and streams. Their geographic distribution ranges as far north as Delaware, as far south as the Florida Keys, and as far west as Texas. They are especially abundant in the Piedmont and coastal plains of North Carolina. Tawain green tree frogs live in bamboo forests and orchards in northern Tawaiin that are between 1200 to 1,800 feet. These green tree frog species are insectivores, feeding on flies , mosquitoes, crickets, locusts, moths , and other small insects . Frogs only have teeth on their upper jaws, and those teeth are designed not to masticate but to hold prey in place. Frogs’ tongues are very long, often one-third the length of their bodies. Typically, frogs stick their tongues out as bait, and once the prey is attracted, frogs retract their tongues, consuming their prey whole. Australian frogs can grow fat from overeating. Hence, one of the species’ nicknames is “dumpy tree frog.” Since the European settlement of Australia, dogs and cats have joined snakes and birds as frog predators. In general, though, these animals have few natural predators, which is reflected in the length of their lifespan: In captivity, it’s not uncommon for these animals to live more than 15 years. Life is more perilous for the American frogs. Predators include snakes , birds , large fish , and even other species of frogs . These amphibians are among the only frog species that breed in bodies of water that are inhabited by predatory fish. As tadpoles, they can even become prey to aquatic insects such as waterbugs. Their lifespans are shorter than those of their counterparts in Australia; in captivity, they seldom live longer than five years. Habitat destruction through drainage and wetland clearance is causing a decline in the size of these frog’s populations in Australia , particularly throughout the Sydney bioregion. Its American counterpart continues to thrive throughout its geographic range, particularly in locales like Florida and North Carolina. However, amphibians are one of the animal groups on the planet that are at the highest risk of extinction from the activities of humans. Because part of their oxygen exchange takes place through their skin, green tree frogs (and other amphibians) are extremely sensitive to pollution and other environmental changes. Ecologists call species like this “indicator species;” their dwindling numbers may be a sign that planetary conditions are worsening. Snakes and birds eat adult green tree frogs. As tadpoles, these amphibians are eaten by birds, fish , insects , and other frogs . Green tree frogs are insectivores. They feed on a diet of flies , mosquitoes, crickets, and other small insects . These frog species breed from the middle of March to September, most often following a rainstorm. Breeding cycles are influenced by temperature and precipitation in a manner that’s not fully understood, but breeding males tend to vocalize more as the temperature rises and the length of the day increases. Mating takes place in water through amplexus: The male frog grasps the female tightly around the back so that their cloacal openings are in close proximity. Fertilization is external. However, the female expels her through the deposited sperm cloud. American frogs lay approximately 400 eggs, while their Australian counterparts lay 150 to 300 eggs. Australian green tree frog eggs take three days to hatch; American green tree frog eggs take two days longer. The resulting offspring are called tadpoles. For the first few weeks of their lives, tadpoles are water dwellers exclusively, and they look like primitive fish with tails, mouths, and rudimentary gill tracts. Then they begin to go through metamorphosis, which is an extraordinary series of physiological changes that prepare them for life on land. These frog populations in the U.S. typically complete metamorphosis within eight weeks; among the Australian animals, however, metamorphosis durations are much more variable, lasting between four and 12 weeks. Neither of these frog species takes any interest in their offspring once the mating process is over. In the United States , these frogs are found in wetlands across the southeastern part of the country and as far west as central Texas. They are common in Florida and North Carolina. They have even been observed in Hawaii , although these animals most likely are descendants of terrarium escapees. Biologists do not have an estimate for the size of the American green tree frog population, but this animal is not on any endangered species list. Australian green tree frogs are found throughout the northeast regions of the continent as well as in New Guinea . In suburban areas, these frogs are threatened by pollution and predator animals like dogs and cats introduced by European settlers. Outside these areas, their population numbers are stable. As native animals, Australian green tree frogs enjoy protected status under the stipulations of the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 .",

    "Name": "Iguana",
    "Text": "Native to the jungles of Central and South America and many islands in the Caribbean, Iguanas are large lizards that are also popular with Americans who want to keep them as pets. The name iguana comes from the original Taino name for these lizards, iwana. Green iguanas are the most widely known species as they are often kept as pets. See all of our expert product reviews . Most pet iguanas have a low price. They are also considered nuisances in Puerto Rico and some parts of the United States , particularly Florida, where they have become an invasive species. You can check out more incredible facts about iguanas . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . There are two main species of iguana: However, there are ten different iguana morphs to look out for: See all of our expert product reviews . The scientific name of this animal is Iguana iguana . It most commonly refers to the green iguana that is distributed through much of the southern United States . All iguanas are reptiles that are members of the order Squamata and the suborder Iguania and the family Iguanidae. The rhino iguana, found primarily on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, has the scientific name Cyclura cornuta . The blue iguana has the scientific name Cyclura lewisi . Other genera include the desert iguana, Dipsosaurus dorsalis , and the marine, Amblyrynchus, and terrestrial, Conolophus, iguanas of the Galapagos Islands. Many believe that marine iguanas evolved from land iguanas brought to the Galapagos and adapted to survive on the land about 4.5 million years ago. Their short, blunt snouts and small, razor-sharp teeth are extremely helpful for scraping algae from rocks. Their flattened tails allow them to move easier through the water. The different species have various sizes ranging from five to seven feet in length. Their whiplike tails make up about half of their body length. The desert iguana is one of the smallest species at only 24 inches long. The blue iguana is the heaviest lizard , weighing up to 30 pounds. These animals have varying scales that cover different parts of their bodies. Some have large round scales that are scattered around their necks among smaller, overlapping scales. Scales on the dorsal trunk are usually thicker and more tightly packed and can be a variety of colors. These reptiles can be difficult to see as their coloration often allows them to blend in with the terrain, which helps them evade predators. These animals vary in color, with some species sporting blue or grey skin. The American green iguana tends to become a more uniform green as they age. Younger lizards have scales that vary between green and brown. The colors of individual iguanas can also vary based on the animal’s mood, temperature, social status, or health. Their skin tends to be darker in the morning when their body temperature is lower and pales as the day heats. Dominant males also tend to have darker coloration. Before courtship, some males become bright orange or golden. Distinguishing features also include a dewlap under the throat, which is particularly developed in males. They also have a dorsal crest on their backs that starts at the neck and ends at the tail. These animals have keen vision, which allows them to see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Their visual acuity allows them to navigate the terrain to locate food and communicate with other members of their species. In the wild, they will seldom fight except when there aren’t enough good places to sun themselves. Basking sites are important as warming themselves by sitting in direct sunlight is essential for body temperature and digestion. Biting injuries in the wild are rare but in captivity, injuries are more common. These animals sometimes travel considerable distances. Females often return annually to the same nesting sites and then travel back to their home territory after laying their eggs. Hatchlings also disperse over a wide area. Green iguanas are arboreal, living at the top ends of forest trees. Juveniles reside lower while mature iguanas live higher up. Living high in the tree canopy allows them to sun themselves easily. They rarely descend to the forest floor except to lay eggs. Although they prefer forests, green iguanas can adapt well to open areas. When near water, they will dive beneath the surface to evade predators. When frightened, they usually freeze, thereby blending into their surroundings or hiding. These animals can drop off part of their tail, giving them a chance to escape. A new tail will sprout and regrow within a year, although it won’t reach its original size. Although they are omnivores, most iguanas in the wild tend to eat a primary herbivore diet. Their favorite foods are the leaves, buds, flowers, and fruits of fig trees. For the first two weeks following hatching, the young reptile eats the yolk from its eggs. As young iguanas need a high amount of protein for adequate growth, they tend to eat more insects than adults. They may occasionally eat invertebrates or small amounts of carrion, although they prefer green leafy plants or ripe fruits. These animals use their tongues to move their food so they can bite it into pieces small enough to swallow with little or no chewing. Older iguanas eat high calcium, low phosphorus diet. Low environmental temperatures inhibit iguanas’ appetites. Usually, eating occurs when temperatures are between 77 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Basking is important to digestion. These lizards may stop eating prior to shedding their skin and when they are about to lay their eggs. Large birds such as hawks and owls prey on juveniles. Dogs and feral cats also prey upon iguanas. Humans also consume these animals and their eggs and use these lizards as bait for crocodiles . The conservation status of most species of least concern as they are widespread. Habitat destruction is another threat, particularly for the blue iguana that is native to the Cayman Islands. This species is listed as endangered because of its shrinking habitat. The rhino iguana is listed as endangered. Rhino iguanas only have a stable population on the island of Isla Beata. These animals exhibit a promiscuous mating style. Courtship occurs during the dry season, with females controlling large territories where they make several nests. Males compete for females by head bobbing, extending and retracting their dewlap, nuzzling and biting the necks of females, and sometimes even changing colors. Females will also display aggressive behavior if good nesting sites are limited. Once a female selects a male, he marks his territory with a pheromone secreted from his hind limbs. Copulation occurs with the male straddling the female and sometimes biting her shoulder to hold her in place. The female then deposits her eggs among the nests she has created. Females can store sperm from previous mates for several years if they cannot find suitable mates when ready to lay eggs. Females lay eggs for approximately 65 days following mating. The number of eggs produced depends on her nutritional status, maturity, and her size. Females will deposit 10 to 30 leathery white or cream-colored eggs in each nest. Nests are sometimes shared among females if nesting sites are limited. Incubation ranges from 90 to 120 days, so the eggs hatch during the wet season. Hatchlings weigh less than a half-ounce at birth, but within three years can weigh just over two pounds. Mature animals usually weigh between nine and 13 pounds, but some can weigh as much as 17.5 pounds. Green iguanas reach sexual maturity between three and four years of age. These animals can live for 15 to 20 years and even longer if cared for properly. At the same time, the San Diego Zoo indicates that some of them can live as long as 60 years. However, wild iguanas have an average lifespan of eight years. You won’t find an overall estimate of the population worldwide because many species have a considerable range and are not in danger of extinction. However, the island of Puerto Rico estimates its iguana population at four million, which means that there are approximately two iguanas for every human on the island. The total population of marine iguanas in the Galapagos Islands is estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000. Iguanas tend to follow a mating style during mostly dry seasons. Mating during the dryer seasons helps to ensure that their offspring will hatch during wet or rainy seasons when food is easier to find. Females tend to control larger areas where they make several different nests. make will then compete for the females in an area and mark their territory with a pheromonal sent from femoral pores on the dorsal side of their back limbs near their tales. Male behavior during sexual competition involves head bobbing, extending, and retracting. They also will nuzzle and bite the necks of females and occasionally change color. Once a female has chosen a male, he will then straddle the female and holds her in place by biting her shoulder. This can sometimes leave scars on females. However, after copulation, eggs are laid within those several nests and incubated. This low level of parental intervention with their offspring makes iguanas an example of r-strategy reproduction. The San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park are home to American iguanas, including the desert iguana that is native to southern California, along with iguanas from other areas of the world, including some of the endangered blue iguanas. The zoo has a ticket package price that allows visitors to see these animals in exhibits and more natural habitats at Safari Park. San Diego Zoo also has programs where you can learn facts about its iguana species. San Diego was the first American zoo to hatch the critically endangered Anegada Island iguana. San Diego Zoo Global works with local governments and conservation organizations to help propagate the more vulnerable species. Keepers use a technique called head starting, where eggs are incubated in a facility, and hatchlings are cared for in large pens. When they are large enough to protect themselves, they are released into the wild. The zoo has also started conservation education programs on several Caribbean islands to give residents and visitors crucial facts about endangered iguanas.",

    "Name": "White Eyed Vireo",
    "Features": "Their yellowish -green plumage",
    "Text": "Vireo griseus, or the white-eyed vireo, are small birds belonging to the Vireonidae family and Passeriformes order. This family contains 60 species of birds! They derived their name because of their white eyes and inhabit several states in North America like Missouri, New Jersey, Florida, and Texas. In addition, they occur in the Bahamas and Cuba. White-eyed vireos like habitats with dense shrubs and bushes, preferably in an abandoned field. In addition, they are a year-round resident in many countries across South America. They have a greenish tinge that blends in well with their surroundings, providing them with the essential camouflage they need. Their mating season begins in April and lasts till August. These birds are monogamous, and both genders build nests and incubate the eggs. Once the eggs hatch, males and females feed the young for several days. Their plumage is yellowish-gray, and they have yellow sides with white bellies. In addition, they have a black beak and legs. Their song consists of six to seven short phrase calls, generally used by the male to attract a mate during the breeding season. However, chicks also use this call. White-eyed vireos are native to North America and Central America . They are Neotropical migrants that participate in seasonal migrations multiple times a year. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . However, they inhabit the southeastern United States and Northern Mexico during mating season. This distribution occurs over states like: These birds are year-round residents along the southeast coastline of the USA from Texas to South Carolina and Mexico. However, during the colder months, most populations will migrate to Belize, Mexico, Cuba, Guatemala, the Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas. They like to inhabit dense, brushy vegetation close to a water source. In order to defend their nesting territory, white-eyed vireo males sing incessantly from early spring to late summer. During courtship, males put on exciting displays by fluffing their plumage, spreading their tails, and letting out a whining call. Then, both genders help to build the nest, which they construct low to the ground in a shrub or sapling. They will weave the rim onto a horizontal forked twig to ensure the nest is secure. The nest is deep and hangs in the shape of a cup. White-eyed vireos make their nest from roots, shreds of bark, twigs, grass stems, leaves, plant down, moss, lichen, and sometimes pieces of wasp nests. They construct their nests with spiderwebs, which help bind them and line them with fine grass, feathers, and fibers. The white-eyed vireo’s scientific name is Vireo griseus, and they belong to the order Passeriformes . The members of this order make up more than half of the entire bird species! Their most distinguishable feature is the arrangement of their toes, with three pointing forwards and one pointing back, this aids with perching. White-eyed vireos are members of the Vireonidae family, which consists of 43 species of small arboreal songbirds, divided between four genera. The relationships of this family with other bird families are not entirely clear, but evidence suggests that they are closely related to the New World warblers. The family Vireonidae is divided into three subfamilies: White-eyed vireos are small birds that measure 5 inches in length and have a wingspan of around 7.4 inches. In addition, adults weigh approximately 0.40 ounces. Their sides are dark olive, and they have black wings and tails. Each wing sports two white wing bars with white or yellow margins on the primaries. Their heads are olive, and they possess a gray nape. However, their most distinctive feature is their illuminating yellow spectacles, which include the area between and around the eyes. Another identifying feature is their white irises, only visible in adults. In addition, they have white bellies and throats and dull yellow sides. Their legs and beaks are a dark black color. Juveniles have dark black irises that only change color when they reach 2 years old. Juveniles differ from adults in more than one way; instead of yellow spectacles, they have white, and their heads are pale gray. In addition, their plumage is paler in comparison to their parents. However, unlike most bird species, both genders look similar. During the mating season, white-eyed vireos spread throughout eastern Texas and travel as far north as southeastern Iowa and Illinois. In addition, they expand as far as southern Ontario, Maryland, and Connecticut in the east. However, in the winter months, white-eyed vireos occupy southern territories in Mexico, and Central America , as far as Honduras. Other winter locations include Bermuda, the Caribbean, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Sometimes these birds get lost while migrating and land up much further west or north than they typically expected. White-eyed vireos are typically solitary but sometimes live in pairs. During their fall migration, it is common for these birds to join mixed foraging flocks containing other species. In order to stay well-hidden, they tend to inhabit lower thickets, which makes it difficult to see their coloration properly. However, their white eyes and yellow spectacles stick out and act as good field marks, even when visuals are obscured. These birds prey primarily on insects and enjoy a range of insects, including spiders and larvae. Sometimes, if there is a food shortage, white-eyed vireos also eat snails and small lizards . In addition, they feed on berries and other fruits. White-eyed vireos are monogamous, and females will visit the males’ territories to choose a mate. The males don’t participate in any sensational courtship displays. However, the pair will court each other for several days, where they will forage together. While these birds are monogamous, they do not mate for life. Surprisingly, they only stay together for one season. The mating season ranges from early April to August, and after pairing up, both genders search for a nesting site. They build their nest off the ground, usually around 3 feet from the surface. Females seek out a comfortable nesting site with a forked branch for support. White-eyed vireos build their nests in a cup shape and construct them with grass, spider silk, twigs, and bark strips. It takes the pair around 3 to 5 days to build the nest and once done, the female lays 3 to 5 white eggs with dark spots. Then, the male and female white-eyed vireos incubate the eggs for around 13 to 15 days. Once hatched, the juveniles leave the nest within 9 to 11 days. However, before they go, both parents share the responsibility of caring for them. As a result, fledglings sometimes depend on their parents for 23 days after leaving the nest. Chicks hatch blind and naked with a few down patches here and there. White-eyed vireos have a unique characteristic; parents develop a brood patch on their bellies, providing the eggs with extra warmth. White-eyed vireos have an average lifespan of 10 years. The predators that prey on white-eyed vireos have rarely been documented, as most predation occurs during the mating season when eggs and hatchlings are abundant. However, it is likely these birds fall prey to : The white-eyed vireo’s numbers are increasing year by year because of their large geographical range and population size, and they are listed as Least Concern on IUCN’s Redlist. However, their numbers could start decreasing because of habitat loss and extensive human activity in their natural habitats. The white-eyed vireo population is increasing, and their population size is estimated at 24 million individuals. There are approximately 60 species of vireos in the world, and while they have similar characteristics, these species differ in some way, shape, or form. Below are four of the most popular species. The yellow-throated vireo is native to parts of eastern North America . They are the most vivacious of the vireo family with their bright yellow and olive-gray plumage. These birds migrate south during winter, primarily to Central America and northern South America. They can become fiercly territorial during winter, especially with members of the same species. They prefer to inhabit deciduous forests and endure human presence. In addition, they can be found in habitats like beaches, shrubs, plantations, and cypress swamps. Yellow-throated vireos are foragers and often fly with mixed flocks, especially when migrating. They let out harsh and scolding calls, and their songs are broken and burry-like. They are very protective of their nests, which are usually built high in trees. Currently, their population is These birds have one of the most purest chirps forming songs that vibrate in the atmosphere. Bell’s vireos are native to North and Central America. Bell’s vireos are small neotropical migratory birds that grow to lengths of 4.5 to 4.9 inches and weigh between 0.2 to 0.3 ounces. They primarily feed on ground and aerial insects . Bell’s vireos have olive-yellow plumage with a tinge of gray. However, their subspecies, the least Bell’s vireo, is mostly gray. Their beaks and legs are dark brown, and they have medium-sized tails. In addition, these birds have a wingspan of 6.7 to 7.5 inches. Bell’s vireos are not endangered and are listed as Least Concern on IUCN’s redlist. Thick-billed vireos are medium-sized birds, approximately 5.5 inches in length. They have greyish olive heads and backs, pale yellow or buffy white underparts, and their undertails are shaded white. In addition, their wings and tails are dark, and they have two white wing bars on each wing. Thick-billed vireos have dark irises, unlike their cousins, the white-eyed vireo, and their bills are large and gray. Lastly, both sexes look alike. Breeding males occur in southeastern Florida and the Florida Keys. In addition, they are common in the Caribbean, where their preferred habitats include dense undergrowth and thickets. The blue-headed vireo has a pleasing palette of bluish gray, moss green, and greenish-yellow, which is complimented by their bold white spectacles, throat, and belly. In addition, they have sharp black wings and tails Like their cousins, the blue-headed vireo forages for larvae and insects in trees, moving swiftly through branches inaccessible by most other bird species. Males below out a slow and happy chorale, which is the first thing to listen for when searching for one. During the warmer months, Blue-headed vireos forage in the canopy of mature forests. They are often heard singing, which helps them distinguish their calls from Philadelphia, yellow-throated, and red-eyed vireos.",

    "Name": "Crab Spider",
    "Text": "Crab Spiders can mimic ants or bird droppings “They look like tiny crabs.” Crab spiders are mostly found in the Thomisidae family, though other spiders known as crab spiders can be found in families such as Selenopidae, Sparassidae, and Sicariidae. These spiders include giant crab spiders such as the enormous Huntsman spider . Crab spiders get their name because they hold their legs crabwise and can move backward and sideways as well as forwards. They are also called flower crab spiders or flower spiders because they can be found on flowers such as roses and goldenrod. They are also found on foliage and under bark or fallen leaves, waiting for prey. The family name Thomisidae was bestowed by the French scientist Charles Athanase Walckenaer. The name derives from the Greek word thominx, which means “cord” or “string.” This is because the spider doesn’t make a web but relies on a single strand of silk. Female spiders deposit their eggs in an egg sac woven of silk or in a nest she weaves in a plant. Females guard their eggs and even the hatchlings until their second molt. The mother dies soon after. It’s probable that she killed and ate the father soon after mating. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Most female crab spiders stay on a plant or other staging ground waiting for prey, while the smaller males wander around. There are 2100 species, around 175 genera, and hundreds of clades in the Thomisidae family. Among them are the Misumena, Bassaniana and Amyciaea genera. Crab spiders in the Amyciaea genus have evolved to mimic ants , particularly weaver ants. Other genera in the Thomisidae family include: Crab spiders can be identified because their four front legs are longer and thicker than their four back legs. Like many spiders, they have eight eyes, and their eyes are often propped on tubercles. They have flat bodies, two claws, and legs that are held crabwise and allow them to run sideways. This is called laterigrade. Besides this, crab spiders come in an amazing variety of colors and patterns. They come in shades of white and black, brown, sky blue, goldenrod yellow, cherry blossom pink, and leaf green with patterns of stripes, bands, spots, and blotches. Generally, male spiders range from 0.079 to 0.276 inches long, while females range from 0.16 to 0.39 inches long. Crab Spiders have evolved to ambush their prey rather than spinning webs to capture them. They have adapted to have stronger front legs and are able to skitter around quickly in any direction, and this movement is from where they receive their name. Some Crab Spiders have evolved the ability to physically change the color of their body to mimic whatever flower or plant they are perched upon. This adaptation has allowed them to survive in nature and capture their food. Other Crab Spiders are able to shape their bodies, such as flattening them, in order to hide in tiny places and wait to ambush their victims. Crab or flower spiders are found everywhere in the world save the coldest or driest places. They perch under leaf litter, beneath tree bark, and on plants and flowers. Crab spiders are found in the tropics, temperate forests, deserts that aren’t too dry, and on mountains that aren’t too cold. Crab spiders eat mostly insects that land too close to where they are hiding. Because their venom is potent for a spider of their size, they can capture insects much bigger than they are. These insects include crickets, grasshoppers , and wasps. Other insects include such pests as aphids, thrips, caterpillars, houseflies, fruit flies, whiteflies, other types of flies, and Japanese beetles, but they can also include beneficial insects such as butterflies and bees . Many crab spiders hunt at night such as the white crab spider, Thomisus spectabilis . Others hunt during the day. Because of their small size, crab spider are typically too small to hurt humans with a bite or venom. Some flower spiders such as Thomisus onustus , the pink crab spider eat the nectar and pollen from the flowers they live on when prey is scarce.",
