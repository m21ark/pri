    "Text": "The lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) is a large freshwater fish native to North America . Contrary to popular belief, it is not actually a true trout . In reality, they belong to the char family. These prized game fish can grow to enormous sizes. They also grow quite slowly, which can make them susceptible to overfishing. The lake trout belongs to the ray-finned class of fish Actinopterygii. Its family, Salmonidae, includes several well-known freshwater fish, including salmon, char, trout, graylings, and lenoks. All members of the Salmonidae family collectively go by the name salmonids, or “salmon-like fish.” The fish’s genus name, Salvelinus, is a Latinized version of the German word saibling, meaning “a char.” Meanwhile, its specific name namaycush derives from the word namekush. Several Southern East Cree tribes in Canada and around Hudson Bay used this word when referring to them. However, some other East Cree used different names, including kukamaw and kukamesh. The Ojibwe-speaking people of the Great Lakes also had their own names for them. Some of the most common Ojibwe names included namegos (lake trout) and namegoshens (little lake trout). Most of their other common names stem from English or French versions of Native American words. For example, the name mackinaw stems from the Algonquin word mitchimakinak , meaning “many turtles.” This word was later adopted for the Michigan port city of “Mackinaw” and, subsequently, the lake trout. Similarly, the French-Canadian word touladi stems from an Eastern Algonquian word for lake trout. On the other hand, some nicknames for them are based solely on their appearance. For instance, some anglers call dark-colored lake trout “mud hens” due to their large size and dark appearance. The lake trout ranks as the largest species of freshwater char . On average, adults measure between 24 and 36 inches long. Anglers commonly catch them weighing anywhere from 15 to 40 pounds. However, given enough time (and food), they can grow to a truly humongous size. The largest lake trout on record weighed almost 102 pounds and clocked in at nearly 50 inches long. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Lake trout possess a noticeably forked tail. Their scales typically range from slate gray to light green on the sides and appear lighter on the belly. However, some specimens can appear dark green, brown, or gray. They feature yellow or cream-colored spots all across the head, body, and fins. In terms of overall appearance, they resemble other salmon, trout, or char. Lake trout are native to North America. Traditionally, they lived in a narrow range throughout Canada, Alaska , and the northeastern United States . In the 19th and 20th centuries, fisheries introduced these fish into new habitats. Today, you can find them in parts of Europe , Asia , and South America . Lake trout were also legally introduced into the Shoshone, Heart, and Lewis Lakes in Yellowstone National Park. However, in the 1980s, they were illegally introduced into Yellowstone Lake, where they are now considered an invasive species. Lake trout prefer cold, oxygen-rich freshwater lakes. They tend to inhabit relatively deep water, particularly during the summer. You can often find them at depths ranging from 60 to 200 feet below the surface. Lake trout normally fill a spot near the top of the food chain in whatever habitat they occupy. As juveniles, they primarily feed on aquatic insects such as mayflies, caddis flies, and midges. They also prey on plankton, terrestrial insects , worms , leeches , and aquatic invertebrates. Mature lake trout will eat just about anything that they can catch. They possess voracious appetites and eat a wide variety of prey, including crustaceans and small fish. Typical prey fish include smelt, minnows, and sculpin . In Yellowstone Lake, they frequently prey on native cutthroat trout. This predatory habit of feeding on cutthroat trout is one of the main reasons people consider them an invasive species in that environment. Since they often inhabit pelagic waters, few mammals , reptiles , and amphibians prey on them. As a result, the only animals that frequently prey on them are other large, predatory fish and birds of prey. Juvenile and mature lake trout share many of the same predators. Aside from humans, some common predators of theirs include eagles , muskies, and northern pike. Most spawn at night during the fall. However, spawning conditions and timing may change depending on the weather and environment. They spawn via broadcast spawning, wherein females spread millions of eggs over several spawning shoals. Males then come by and externally fertilize the eggs with their sperm. The eggs take anywhere from 4 to 6 months to hatch. Young lake trout, known as fry, tend to hide near the lake bed until they grow larger enough to move into open water to hunt. In the wild, these fish mature at different rates depending on their environment. Experts separate lake trout into two broad categories: planktivorous trout and piscivorous trout. Planktivorous variants live in lakes that lack pelagic forage fish. These trout mature slowly and tend not to grow especially large. Meanwhile, piscivorous variants live in lakes that do contain deep-water food sources. Piscivorous lake trout typically mature much more quickly and can grow to an enormous size. They also tend to be far less abundant than planktivorous lake trout. On the far end of the spectrum, long-lived lake trout can reach over 20 years old. You can cook lake trout in various ways, including baked, grilled, fried, or boiled. That said, the most popular ways to cook this fish include grilling and baking. They have a strong, fishy taste that is more pronounced than salmon or whitefish. Due to this strong flavor, some people shy away from cooking it. However, you can reduce its flavor by first bleeding and soaking the fish. It possesses juicy, firm meat, so if you like eating other freshwater fish, you’ll probably enjoy it. Populations of this fish vary by region. In Lake Superior, their numbers declined during the late 19th century and early 20th century due to overharvest. However, thanks to strong regulations, their numbers rebounded in the 1970s. According to some experts, approximately 100 million of them live in Lake Superior. Today, commercial fisheries continue to harvest them in the Great Lakes. However, fishing is more tightly controlled today than in earlier decades. Still, native populations are under threat in a number of lakes throughout Canada and the northern United States. As a result, the General Status of Alberta Wild Species report lists them as a Sensitive species."

    "Name": "Brook Trout",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats opportunistic and especially likes insects, amphibians, invertebrates, minnows, and other smaller fish",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "“This popular fish is a star in recreational fishing” sums up the feeling anglers have about the Brook Trout. Brook Trout is a freshwater fish native to Eastern North America , specifically the northern areas of the United States and Canada . It is a popular sport fish, especially for fly fishermen. It lives in cool, clear water in remote and mountainous areas. Also known as the speckled trout, it has unique coloring with yellow spots over an olive-green background, transitioning to orange and red along its sides and belly. The scientific name for Brook Trout is Salvelinus fontinalis . “ Fontinalis ” comes from Latin for “of a spring or fountain.” This is about the cool, clear water where the Brook Trout thrive. They are in the Order Salmoniformes , and the family Salmonidae . This family, known as Salmonoids, includes salmon , trout , char , and freshwater whitefish. They all spawn in freshwater, but many spend most of their life feeding in saltwater. While Brook Trout does not have multiple species, they adapt to different ecological forms depending on their environment. They grow at different rates and act differently, though they have the same appearance. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Robert J. Behnke described three different forms in his landmark book: Brook Trout have a dark olive green color with lighter yellow dots or speckles. Their body is wide in the middle and tapers to both ends. Its head has a large mouth and a rounded snout. They have a marbled pattern along their back, also called vermiculation. The belly and lower fins are orange-reddish, with the fins having a white leading edge. Full-grown lengths can vary between 10 to 25 inches and weigh between 0.6 to 6.6 pounds. However, most fishermen catch fish that are much smaller. The world record was caught in 1915 in Ontario and was 31 inches long. Brook trout can be found in cool, clear freshwater streams, rivers, and lakes in the eastern United States and Canada. These fish were established in their native areas before the 19 th century due to the clear, undisturbed water. As the land around the native areas developed, the water became polluted from runoff, streams were dammed, or the water was silted. When the water became too warm from silt or algae growth from fertilizer runoff, the Brook Trout did not thrive and, in some areas, was extirpated. Brook Trout is generally not considered threatened in remote areas where they are well established. Sport fisherman will typically catch them with a fly rod during the mornings or evenings when they are most active. Brook Trout can also be found in the northern Rocky Mountains, where they are considered invasive. They were introduced here outside of their native range and are a threat to the native cutthroat trout. In some areas of Yellowstone National Park , anglers may take an unlimited number of Brook Trout. In the Lamar River, it is required to kill any Brook Trout caught and not return them to the water. Brook Trout are opportunistic feeders, and their diet is diverse. Aquatic insects such as mayflies , stoneflies, and caddisflies are preferred. They will also eat land-based insects, amphibians , smaller fish , and almost any other animal in the water that is smaller than them, even young Brook Trout. Predators are typical of other fish, including larger fish and birds. Predators include heron , kingfishers , otters , snapping turtles , snakes , and other larger fish. Their typical diet includes insects, amphibians, invertebrates, minnows, and other smaller fish; almost anything they can fit in their mouth. Brook Trout will spawn in the fall, from October to early November. The female will create a shallow, “redd” nest in a clean area with small gravel or stones. She will lay around 100-400 eggs, and multiple males will fertilize the eggs. The female will then bury the eggs with the gravel. The eggs will remain over the winter and hatch about 90-100 days later in the spring. These fish will mature in about 2 to 3 years and typically live about 6 years. Brook Trout are a popular fish for both sport fisherman and raising commercially. The meat is light and delicate and has a slightly sweet flavor compared to other trout. They are most popular in their native regions. However, they are commercially sold as smoked trout in many areas. Since Brook Trout require cool, clear water, they are usually found in remote mountainous areas, which can be challenging to reach. They reside in mountain streams and rivers and congregate in small areas where the water flow is slow, along the back side of boulders. They can be caught with spinning rods with light tackle, but the most popular is with a fly rod. With fly fishing, targeting these small areas where Brook Trout rests in slower water is easier. Brook Trout can be prepared in many ways, from grilled, braised, and pan-fried. Because of its delicate flavoring, minimal seasoning is needed. Since they are usually small, panfrying them whole is the most popular way. A 3-ounce serving contains 18 grams of protein and 2.3 grams of fat."

    "Name": "Yellow Sac Spider",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats insects, other spiders",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "A Yellow Sac Spider is a beneficial species native to the United States where it is found primarily in the northeastern to midwestern states. Similar species to the American version are found in many countries around the world including Germany and Australia . These spiders are active hunters who do not wait in a web for prey to come to them, but rather go out in search of food. They are nocturnal, so they do build small “sac” webs or nests in which to rest during the day. There are two species of Yellow Sac Spider in the United States. Cheiracanthium inclusum is the scientific name for the native species of Yellow Sac Spider, although this was not always the case. Originally, it was placed in the Clubionidae family, and then later the Miturgidae family, before finally being labeled as Cheiracanthiidae. C. mildei is the other species found in the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada. It is native to Europe, North Africa , and Central Asia, but it was introduced to North America, possibly by early colonists. C. punctorium is another species of Yellow Sac found in Europe . The name of this spider comes from its yellow or yellowish beige color and the fact that its web is not really a web but a sac-shaped place for resting instead of for catching prey. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . A Yellow Sac’s size ranges from .2 to .4 inches, so it is small. Its legs are significantly longer than its quarter-inch body. The front two legs will be longer than the other six legs. They are typically very pale, sometimes even bordering on translucent, and the tips of their legs are much darker than the rest of their legs. Yellow sac spiders have two rows of eyes, with four symmetrical eyes on each row. They tend to have a stripe from the middle of their body to the back, but this can be hard to see on some colorations. There is some fear of these spiders because Yellow Sacs have been known to bite humans; however, there is little cause for alarm when encountering or even being bitten by a Yellow Sac Spider. Although they are somewhat venomous, mildly aggressive when provoked, and their bite can, in extremely rare cases, create necrotic tissue, Yellow Sac Spider venom is nowhere near as potent as that of a Brown Recluse and is not remotely potent enough to be fatal to humans. There is actually only one documented case of a Yellow Sac bite causing necrotic tissue. Yellow Sac Spiders can be found in the woods and in homes and gardens. These spiders are hunters, but they tend to stick within a few yards of their resting webs. They like to make these under woodpiles and yard debris, behind clutter, and around baseboards. Inside the home, they like dark, damp places with lots of places to hide and prey to hunt. Yellow Sac Spiders are carnivores, although they will occasionally drink nectar. They enjoy hunting insects that we normally consider pests, including cockroaches and insect eggs. They will also eat other smaller spiders and, when resources are limited, will even consume their own egg sacs. Positively identify the Yellow Sac Spider using the tips listed above. Do not get close enough to allow the spider to bite you because they are aggressive when bothered. A bite from a Yellow Sac Spider will most likely be red and swollen. Sometimes it is possible to see fang marks, but this is not common. As previously stated, Yellow Sac Spider bites are not deadly. If you are bitten, the bite may be quite painful for 90 minutes or so. After that, the most common symptoms will be redness, itchiness, and swelling. In some rare instances, the person may feel nauseated. There has been only one documented case of such a bite developing an ulcer, also known as necrotic tissue. The most important thing to do if bitten by a Yellow Sac, as with any wound, is to keep the bite area clean and dry, perhaps with some over-the-counter antibiotic ointment and a bandage, to reduce the risk of infection. Recovery usually happens within just a few hours. If symptoms persist much longer than that, get worse, or in the unlikely event that the bitten person shows any signs of anaphylactic shock, seek medical attention immediately. The easiest thing to do, if you live in an area where Yellow Sac Spiders are common, is to avoid a bite altogether. To do this, always wear gloves when gardening or picking up firewood or lawn debris, particularly in colder months. Shake out any clothing in closets that haven’t been worn in a long time. Keep your home as clutter-free as possible."

    "Name": "Black Bass",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats insects, crayfish, aquatic invertebrates, fish",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "The term black bass is used to refer to 13 different species of fish in the genus Micropterus. This genus includes well-known species such as the largemouth bass , smallmouth bass , and spotted bass . All black bass species hail from freshwater waterways throughout North America . Anglers prize black bass as game fish due to their size and willingness to fight when hooked. Freshwater black bass belong to the ray-finned fish order Perciformes or “perch-like” fish. They are members of the family Centarchidae or sunfish , which includes eight different genera. Other members of the family include crappies, Sacramento perch, rock bass, mud sunfish, and banded sunfish. The name centrarchus derives from the Greek words kentron, meaning “sharp point,” and archos, meaning “rectum.” Black bass belong to the genus Micropterus. The origin of the genus name stems from a case of mistaken identity. The word micropterus derives from the New Latin micro, meaning “small,” and ptero, meaning “feather” or “winged.” When it was first described, the identified black bass specimen had a mutilated fin. This led the researcher to incorrectly assume that all black bass possessed small fins. Some species in the black bass genus get their specific or common name from a distinguishing physical feature. For example, the largemouth bass gets its name from its characteristic large lower lip. Similarly, the redeye bass features bright red eyes. Meanwhile, other species get their name from their physical location. For instance, the Florida bass is native to Florida , while the Guadalupe bass is native to parts of Texas , including the Guadalupe River. Many people also incorrectly assume that black bass get their common name from the dark color on their sides. In reality, the term black bass stems from the color of juvenile smallmouth bass. Smallmouth bass fry turn “coal black” a few days after hatching. Over time, this term came to refer to all black bass species, not just juvenile smallmouth bass. Here is a list of all 13 recognized species in the genus Micropterus : See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . They vary in appearance depending on the species. That said, all 13 species share a number of similarities. All black bass appear primarily dull-green and sport dark-colored scales on their sides. They range in size but typically grow between 16 and 24 inches long. However, some species can grow up to a maximum of 30 inches . Females typically measure larger than males. Like other sunfishes, the dorsal fin contains both spiny and soft-rayed portions joined into a single fin. From there, unique variations allow experienced anglers to distinguish one black bass from another. Here’s how you can identify a few of the most common black bass species. The Alabama bass features blotches on its sides but not on its dorsal fin. The spiny and soft sections of its dorsal fin connect together with a shallow notch. It sports 10 spines in its dorsal fin and 3 spines in its anal fin. The number of lateral scales varies but typically ranges between 68 and 84. The largemouth bass’s upper jaw extends past its eye, while the lower jaw juts notably past the upper jaw. Most largemouth bass sport dark lateral blotches down each side from the snout to the caudal fin. However, the presence of these blotches can vary depending on the environment where largemouth bass live. The number of lateral line scales varies between 59 and 72 in most specimens. In terms of overall appearance, the Florida bass closely resembles the largemouth bass. As a result, some experts recognize the Florida bass as a largemouth bass subspecies. The main differences separating the two are size and growth rates. Northern largemouth bass grow more slowly and measure smaller than Florida bass. Florida bass frequently grow to weigh 20 pounds or more, as compared to the average of 10 pounds for northern largemouth bass. The smallmouth bass sports 3 dark bars on each cheek and between 8 and 16 vertical lateral bars on each side. Unlike the largemouth bass, its upper jaw does not extend past the eye. It also features more lateral line scales, running from 67 to 81, depending on the specimen. Black bass are widely distributed throughout North America. Historically, they ranged mostly throughout the eastern half of the continent. In particular, you could find them east of the Rocky Mountains, from Hudson Bay in Canada to northeastern Mexico . Today, several black bass species live outside of their native range. In particular, you can now find largemouth and smallmouth bass throughout much of the world. Black bass live in a wide range of habitats, including rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. However, different species prefer certain environments over others. For example, smallmouth bass typically inhabit clearer water than largemouth bass. Meanwhile, redeye bass enjoy calm water along banks or inlets, while Guadalupe bass prefer fast-flowing water. That said, several black bass species live within a very narrow range. For instance, redeye bass are native to the Coosa River system of Georgia and Alabama . Similarly, the Suwannee bass and shoal bass are both native to the waters of Florida and Georgia . The spotted bass ranges throughout the Mississippi River basin and the southeast, while the Guadalupe bass is endemic to Texas, particularly the Guadalupe River. Adults are often at the top or near the top of the food chain in their respective environment. This is especially true for larger species, such as largemouth bass or Florida bass. However, numerous large predatory fish prey on black bass, including northern pike, crappie , walleye , channel catfish, and common carp . Other predators of black bass include great blue herons , kingfishers, bitterns, hawks , and eagles . That said, humans likely rank among the greatest threats to most black bass. Nearly all prey on aquatic invertebrates, insects , worms , crayfish , and fish. However, each species prefers certain prey over others. Shoal bass mainly feed on insects near the water surface. Juvenile smallmouth bass mostly eat plankton and insects, while the adults also prey on amphibians , crayfish, and fish. Suwannee bass primarily eat crayfish, although they will also eat fish and invertebrates. Meanwhile, largemouth bass and Florida bass start out eating copepods, shrimp , and insects. Once they mature, the adults’ diet expands dramatically to include frogs , snakes , salamanders , fish, and bats , as well as small turtles , alligators , and mammals . Most reach sexual maturity between 1 and 3 years old. Spawning typically takes place in spring between March and June as water temperatures start to warm. The optimal temperature varies depending on the species but typically ranges between 64 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit. Males usually kickstart the spawning season by constructing a shallow nest near the banks of rivers or lakes. Nest sites vary by species, but are typically located on gravel, mud, or sand beds. The female then comes by and lays her eggs in the nest, which the male fertilizes externally with his sperm. The number of eggs can range anywhere from a few hundred to up to 20,000, depending on the species. Once the female lays her eggs, she leaves, and the male remains to guard the nest. The male will remain guard until the eggs hatch, and the fry leave the nest. They generally live between 10 and 12 years in the wild. However, some specimens can live up to 15 years. Many anglers catch and release them that they catch in the wild. However, many anglers keep and cook black bass. Most people would say that black bass has a somewhat “fishy” taste. However, the flavor of black bass varies depending on the species. Generally, the larger the fish, the more fishy it tastes. For example, smallmouth bass tends to taste more mild and clean than largemouth bass. You can use multiple methods when preparing and cooking black bass. These include boiling, sauteing, baking, frying, and grilling. That said, most people prefer to fry or grill black bass filets. Grilling is more popular for larger filets, while frying is more popular for smaller filets. You can use a wide range of sauces, herbs, and spices to up the flavor of black bass even more. Their populations vary depending on the species. Most species occur in large enough numbers that the IUCN lists them as Least Concern . Moreover, some species – such as largemouth bass and smallmouth bass – are now so widespread that experts classify them as cosmopolitan species. On the other hand, some black bass species live in a much more narrow range. For example, shoal bass appear to be decreasing in the Apalachicola and Chipola rivers due to a lack of spawning beds and competition with other species. Presently, the IUCN lists the shoal bass as a Near Threatened species. Similarly, the Suwannee bass lives in just two river systems in Georgia and Florida. Due to declining numbers, the IUCN classifies the Suwannee bass as Near Threatened. Black bass are apex predators that prey on a wide variety of other animals. Their diet includes plankton, aquatic invertebrates, crayfish, and fish. Some larger species will also eat small amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. The largemouth bass or Florida bass ranks as the largest black bass species. Some experts classify Florida bass as a subspecies of largemouth bass. Florida bass tend to grow larger than northern largemouth bass. As the weather gets colder, some species will migrate in search of deeper pools. They seek out deeper water to help them enter a semi-hibernative state. You can catch them using a wide variety of methods depending on the species. Some tend to stick close to shore, vegetated areas, or underwater objects. Meanwhile, others tend to prefer deep, open water."

    "Name": "Rufous Hummingbird",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats some insects and enjoys red flowers",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "This hummingbird has brilliant coloring and can travel from Alaska to Mexico in one migration. As one of nine species of hummingbirds in its genus, the Rufous hummingbird is named for the reddish-orange coloring that most males have on their heads and chests. They favor red-colored flowers but also eat insects. Learn more about these fascinating birds . The Rufous hummingbird is native to North America , from Alaska to Mexico. They breed in Alaska and the Western parts of Canada and the United States during the spring and summer. They take advantage of native wildflowers in these regions as a reliable source of food. For the winter, they travel almost 4,000 miles to migrate to parts of Mexico. They need a warm climate to survive and cannot overwinter in the northern parts of the continent. This little hummingbird is known by the scientific name Selasphorus rufus . It is one species within the Selasphorus genus. There are nine species within the genus, which was established in 1832. The Rufous hummingbird is the type species. Previously, it was placed in the Trochilus genus along with other hummingbirds when it was discovered and described in 1788. The Rufous hummingbird is part of the Trochilidae family. It includes all hummingbirds, around 360 species in total. Hummingbirds are recognized by their ability to hover and feed on nectar, although they also eat insects . They were given the name hummingbird due to the humming sound that their fast-beating wings make when they hover. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Hummingbirds belong to the Apodiformes order of birds, which also includes Swifts and Treeswifts. It is one of the most diverse orders of birds and has more than 450 species. They are part of the Aves class, which includes all birds. Birds are characterized by the presence of feathers, toothless beaks, a heart with four chambers, a high metabolism, and a lightweight skeleton. All birds also lay eggs to reproduce. Hummingbirds are part of the Chordata phylum and Animalia kingdom. While the Rufous hummingbirds are native to North America, they are part of a larger species of hummingbirds that began in Europe around 42 million years ago, when they began to diverge from their closest living relatives, the swift. The oldest known fossil is from southeast Germany, around 30 million to 35 million years ago. However, this species became extinct in Europe, it is still unknown how or why, and eventually migrated to North America and South America. The hummingbird of today evolved in the Americas about 22 million years ago. The Rufous hummingbird is in a genus that includes eight other species. This genus, Selasphorus , has the following hummingbirds: These tiny hummingbirds are around three inches long. They are not the smallest of all hummingbirds but do represent a good example of these interesting animals. The males are brightly colored, with a reddish-orange face. This gave them their name, Rufous, based on this coloring. They have white breasts and an iridescent orange patch on their throat. In fact, the Audubon Society Guide to North American Birds describes it as “glowing like a copper penny.” This helps bird watchers spot Rufous Hummingbirds easier, although this coloring is unique to the males. Some males also have green coloring on their backs or at the crown of their heads. Females more often have green coloring and are slightly larger than the males. They look similar to the Allen’s hummingbird, which also lives in many of the same places. Like other species of hummingbirds, the Rufous hummingbird eats nectar from flowers. It uses a long proboscis and tongue to access the nectar buried deep in the flower’s structure. It also eats insects that it catches on its wings. They tend to feed on red flowers , including penstemons, red columbines, paintbrush, scarlet sage, and gilia. When feeding, the Rufous hummingbird hovers in mid-air using its wings. They use downstrokes to generate lift at a greater rate than upstrokes. When feeding on sugar substances at hummingbird feeders, they do perch when given the chance. This helps them conserve energy, although they do not perch for long periods of time. Because they are small, Rufous hummingbirds can be prey for other larger birds and animals. Snakes in particular are quick to make a meal out of an unsuspecting Rufous hummingbird. Other threats include changes to their habitat and food sources. Pesticides can impact the availability of insects that make up a critical part of their diet. They are not picky when it comes to the type of insects that they eat, although there does need to be a ready supply. Early blooming of their flower food source can also make it hard for them to get enough to eat. They migrate and if the flowers have already bloomed by the time they get to their destination, Rufous Hummingbirds are not able to get the nectar inside. Like all other birds, the Rufous hummingbird lays eggs . The females build nests in trees and shrubs that are protected and hidden from predators. She uses moss to help the nest blend in better. They can also use old nests and refurbish them with additional grass, moss, and plant matter to make it sturdy and soft. The males will mate with more than one female, who then looks after the eggs until they hatch. This typically takes around two weeks. The females feed the young hummingbirds, who eventually leave the nest and fly around three weeks old. They typically stay around the Pacific Northwest when breeding, including Oregon , Washington , and Canada. They can travel as far north as Alaska, although they are less common in this area. Scientists are watching the Rufous Hummingbird population, which has been declining in recent years. While not listed as endangered, the International Union for Conservation of Nature did upgrade it to Near Threatened in 2018 based on population numbers and observations. The Nature Conservancy Canada estimates that its numbers have declined by as much as 60% since data was collected in the mid-1960s. The change in climate and temperature are thought to be the biggest threats to this hummingbird. As migratory birds , they rely on the seasons to dictate not only their nesting habits but also make their food sources available. If these change, it can have long-term effects on the Rufous Hummingbird population. Allen’s Hummingbird : This hummingbird, known by its scientific name Selasphorus sasin , is closely related to the Rufous Hummingbird and has similar coloring. It tends to stay near California , however, and has a more limited geographic range. Ruby-throated Hummingbird : The Archilochus colubris has a brighter patch of ruby-colored feathers at its throat, which makes it easy to spot. It lives in similar climates to the Rufous Hummingbird but also goes to the Eastern United States to breed."

    "Name": "Golden Shiner",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, crustaceans",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "The golden shiner ( Notemigonus crysoleucas ) is a member of the Old World true minnow family Leuciscinae. You can find golden shiners throughout eastern North America , including the United States and Canada . Anglers often used golden shiners as bait fish to catch larger fish , including largemouth bass , crappie , and walleye . Thanks to their shiny golden scales, they are also frequently introduced into public and private ponds. Keep reading to learn all about the golden shiner. The golden shiner belongs to the carp and minnow family Cyprinidae. The word Cyprinidae derives from the Greek word kyprinos, meaning “carp,” and the Latin ending -idae, meaning “resemblance” or “appearance.” It is a member of the Old World “true minnow” subfamily Leuciscinae. As the name implies, most species in Leuciscinae live or originated in Eurasia, hence their other common name, European minnows. The golden shiner is the exception to this rule, representing the only true minnow outside Eurasia. The golden shiner belongs to the genus Notemigonus, of which it is the sole member. Its genus name derives from the Greek words noton, meaning “back,” and gonia, meaning “angled.” This name refers to the noticeable downward curve of the back between the front and rear of the dorsal fin. The golden shiner’s specific name, crysoleucas , stems from the Greek words cryso, meaning “gold,” and leucas, meaning “white.” Like its genus name, the golden shiner’s specific name refers to its physical appearance. In this case, it refers to the golden color frequently seen on the sides of larger specimens and the white color on the belly. Similarly, the golden shiner’s common name refers to its typical golden hue. The name “shiner” refers to several small cyprinid and perch fish found in North America, including eastern shiners, redside shiners, and flagfin shiners. Most shiners appear partially silver, which is true of smaller or juvenile golden shiners. In the French-speaking parts of Quebec, Canada, the golden shiner is named “Mene jaune” or “Chatte de l’Est.” Mene jaune translates roughly to “led (me to) yellow,” while Chatte de l’Est roughly means “cat of the East” or “eastern cat.” On average, most golden shiners measure between 3 and 5 inches long. That said, especially large individuals can grow up to 12 under certain conditions. Golden shiners possess deep bodies and feature a noticeable downward curve to the lateral line along the back. They possess small, upturned mouths and large scales. The back appears olive or dark green, while the belly appears white. Additionally, the belly sports a fleshy keel between the anal and pelvic fins that lack scales. It is the only minnow known to feature such a keel. Juvenile or smaller golden shiners typically have silvery sides, while larger specimens have golden sides, hence their name. The dorsal fin always contains 8 rays, while the anal fin can feature anywhere from 8 to 19 rays. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The golden shiner is the only Old World true minnow in the family Leuciscinae found outside of Eurasia. Its native range stretches throughout the eastern half of North America. You can find it as far north as the St Lawrence River and the Great Lakes region and as far south as Florida . Its native range extends from the eastern coast of Canada and the United States to central Texas and the western parts of the Dakotas. Due to its popularity as a bait fish has also been introduced into many ponds and waterways outside its native range. While relatively rare in the western half of North America, established populations exist in California , Arizona , Montana , and Colorado . Golden shiners tend to live in quiet, slow-moving waters. As a result, you can usually find them in lakes, ponds, ditches, or sloughs. However, they may also inhabit some slow-moving rivers or streams. They like areas with plenty of weeds and other vegetation that grant them access to food and cover from predators. Golden shiners can tolerate water conditions that would kill or significantly impact other fish. They possess amazing tolerance to heat, pollution, low oxygen, and turbidity. Numerous larger fish and other animals prey on golden shiners. Common golden shiner predators include bass, trout , crappie, walleye, pike , catfish , and yellow perch . Large birds such as herons , egrets, and kingfishers also feed on golden shiners. In certain environments, mammals like mink and otters will also prey on golden shiners. When attacked and bitten by a predator, golden shiners release a special chemical from their skin cells called schreckstoff. Nearby golden shiners can detect this chemical and – upon its detection – will quickly vacate the area. Golden shiners are crepuscular omnivores that feed mostly around dawn and dusk. Their diet consists primarily of plankton, including phytoplankton and zooplankton. However, they will also readily eat insects , small crustaceans , algae, and other aquatic vegetation. You can find golden shiners feeding throughout the water column, including the surface, bottom, and near mid-water. They find food using both visual cues and filter feeding. Golden shiners move in shoals to find food. Remarkably, the shoal often follows the movements of the fish near the front of the group. These individuals tend to measure smaller than fish in the middle or back of the shoal. Experts believe that smaller fish may possess a greater motivation to find food. The larger fish then follow the visual cues of the smaller fish to find food. In the southern part of their range, golden shiners reach sexual maturity at a young age. In warmer waters, they frequently start to reproduce at around 1 year old. Meanwhile, golden shiners that live in cold waters further north don’t reach sexual maturity until around 3 years old. Regardless, spawning normally occurs in spring when water temperatures reach an optimal range. This range varies but usually falls within the range of 70-to-80-degrees Fahrenheit. Unlike some fish, golden shiners do not build their own nests and show no parental care. Instead, female golden shiners normally scatter their eggs over vegetation or algae. Sometimes, females may lay their eggs in the nests of larger fish, such as largemouth bass. Known as brood parasitism, this tactic likely aids both the golden shiner and host fish, reducing the likelihood of the host’s eggs being eaten when predators raid the nest. A single golden shiner female can lay up to 200,000 eggs at a time. Most golden shiners live between 3 and 6 years in the wild. However, captive golden shiners that receive adequate food and care can live up to 8 years. Due to their small size and status as bait fish, people rarely, if ever, eat golden shiners. Still, they are edible, and people can and do sometimes cook them. In terms of taste, larger specimens taste similar to – if slightly stronger than – bluegill. They have a lot of bones, but the bones are quite large, making them easy to eat. The meat appears quite white when cooked and rather flaky. If you enjoy eating freshwater fish, you may enjoy the taste of golden shiner. That said, most anglers agree that golden shiners don’t rank as the best-tasting fish in the world. Thanks to its popularity as a game fish and its shiny appearance, golden shiners have been introduced into numerous ponds and lakes throughout North America. In fact, it likely ranks as the most popular pond-cultured fish in the United States. Even before its rise in popularity, golden shiners enjoyed widespread distribution. They live in large shoals and can quickly expand their population due to the high fecundity of the females. As a result, the IUCN lists the golden shiner as a species of Least Concern . Golden shiners are omnivores that feed on various plankton, including zooplankton and phytoplankton. They also feed on plants, algae, insects, and small crustaceans. Most wild golden shiners measure between 3 and 5 inches long. However, they can grow up to 12 inches long in captivity. A female golden shiner can lay up to 200,000 eggs. They sometimes lay their eggs in the nests of other, larger fish, such as bass or bowfin. Anglers often use golden shiners as bait fish to catch larger, predatory fish. Fish commonly caught with golden shiners include crappie, walleye, and largemouth bass."

    "Name": "Black Footed Ferret",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats prairie dogs, ground squirrels, birds, insects",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "“The black-footed ferret is the only ferret native to North America” The habitat of Black-footed ferrets includes a range extending over the plains of Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, and Arizona. They are carnivores with a diet consisting mostly of prairie dogs. These mammals have a long, sleek body that allows them to easily fit into tunnels and burrows. They are solitary animals with a lifespan of 3 to 4 years in the wild. Mustela nigripes is the scientific name of the black-footed ferret. Mustela is a Latin word meaning weasel while nigripes translates to black-footed. This animal is sometimes called an American polecat . It belongs to the Mustelidae family and the class Mammalia. The black-footed ferret has a long, slender bod y with white to cream-colored fur on its back along with black feet and a black-tipped tail. One of the most notable facts about its appearance is the black fur on its face that makes it look like it’s wearing a mask. This ferret aka American polecat measures 18 to 24 inches in length with a tail 5 to 6 inches long. An adult black-footed ferret weighs an average of 2 pounds. Males are normally bigger than females. As a comparison, a 24-inch-long ferret is equal to 11 golf tees lined up end to end. A 2-pound black-footed ferret is equal in weight to 1 ½ basketball. The heaviest black-footed ferret weighs in at 2.5 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The black-footed ferret has many adaptations that help it to survive in its habitat. For one, its wiry, slender body allows it to slip into a prairie dog burrow in pursuit of its prey. Its large eyes help this mammal to see in the dark. Another one of its amazing adaptations is a strong sense of smell. This ferret finds prey and navigates its environment by detecting the scents all around it. The cream-colored coat of this ferret helps it to blend into its habitat so it can hide from predators. This animal’s sharp claws are used to dig into the ground to create a new burrow or expand an existing one. A strong jaw helps this ferret to capture and hold a prairie dog. When one ferret spots a predator near its burrow, the animal starts to chatter and hiss to signal danger to other ferrets nearby. Black-footed ferrets are solitary animals. But, when they do form a group it’s called a business. There are usually 3 or more ferrets in a business. These mammals are shy but may become aggressive during mating season. Black-footed ferrets are part of the large Mustelid family which itself consists of 55 species. Included in that family are mink, otters, and weasels. A common feature most members share is an elongated, slender body, comparatively short legs and a small head with a short snout, and a preference for a carnivorous diet. Ferrets’ earliest known ancestor Mustela stromeri is believed to have also been the forbear of two mid-Pleistocene subspecies, Mustela eversmanni and M. putorius. Black-footed ferrets are believed to have emerged about 2 million years ago developing a preference for a diet of prairie dogs after evolving simultaneously with them over millennia. They are also believed to have already been living in North America, by the Late Paleolithic, about 100,000 years ago. Decades ago, the population of the black-footed ferret was so low the species was thought to be extinct. Their numbers were greatly decreased by a plague that ran through the prairie dog population. It is known as the sylvatic plague and is carried by fleas . It kills 90 percent of the prairie dogs that become infected. When the prairie dog population goes down it takes away the main component in the diet of the black-footed ferrets. As a result, these ferrets began to die off in large numbers. Habitat loss is another reason why the population of the black-footed ferret has fallen so low. Expansion of farmland destroys many of the prairie dog burrows where these ferrets live . One of the most amazing facts is a small population of black-footed ferrets was discovered in 1981. With the help of captive breeding programs and more community education, this ferret’s population slowly began to increase. However, officially, the black-footed ferret is still Endangered . Black-footed ferrets are native to North America . They live in a range that includes Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, and South Dakota. They live in a temperate location of plains and grasslands. These ferrets don’t migrate. But, they do spend more time in their burrows during the winter season. These animals are carnivores. The diet of this ferret consists mainly of prairie dogs. In fact, this prairie dog hunter eats approximately 100 of these rodents in the course of a year! If one prairie dog weighs 3 pounds, that means a black-footed ferret eats 300 pounds of prairie dogs per year. Imagine, 300 pounds is equal to nine-tenths the weight of a panda bear . Golden eagles , owls , coyotes , bobcats , and badgers are all predators of these animals. Most of these predators are nocturnal as well. An owl flying over the plains can easily see the movements of a black-footed ferret and swoop down to capture one. Or, a bobcat can choose a location near the burrow of a black-footed ferret and wait until it ventures out looking for food at night. Prairie dogs make up the biggest part of the diet of these animals. This is why this animal is known as an expert prairie dog hunter! They also may eat ground squirrels , mice , rats , rabbits , reptiles , birds , and sometimes insects . The conservation status of the black-footed ferret is Endangered. When its main diet of prairie dogs decreases, the population of ferrets goes down as well. Also, this ferret is threatened by habitat loss due to land development. They are sometimes killed by farmers who consider them pests that may go after their chickens and smaller livestock. There are conservation actions being taken now to protect this ferret. These actions include captive breeding and educating the public about these unique animals. The breeding season of these animals happens in March and April. In this species, female ferrets compete for males. The gestation period of a female is 41 to 43 days. They give live birth to 3 to 4 babies also called kits. The female ferret cares for the kits in the burrow after they are born. The male doesn’t play a part in the care of the young. Newborn ferrets weigh from 0.2 to 0.3 ounces. They are born with their eyes closed and have a thin coat of white hair. They are mostly helpless until their eyes open. In about 3 weeks, they begin to get black markings on their fur, and their eyes open at 35 days old. After being weaned at around 3 months old, the kits begin to venture out of their underground location as their mother teaches them how to hunt for food. They stay with their mother for about 5 or 6 months before going off to live independently. The lifespan of these animals is 3 to 4 years. The record for the oldest black-footed ferret is 9 years. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the population of these animals consists of 206 mature individuals. The conservation status of this ferret is endangered , and they have a decreasing population."

    "Name": "Black Wasp",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats grasshoppers, cicadas, locusts, katydids, and other fleshy insects",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "The black wasp, which is often referred to as the Great Black Wasp, is rather small, and it is grouped with other insects under the digger wasp species. They go by the scientific name Sphex pensylvanicus . They are found all across North America . They are found all over the United States , spanning from the west coast to the east coast. They survive in many different climates because of their adaptability. The western United States is their preferred environment, due to the warmth. Here are a few interesting facts about black wasps: While the phrase “black wasp” can be used for many different species of wasp, in general, wasps are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor with bees and ants around 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. Black wasps, like all wasps, have undergone significant changes and adaptations over millions of years to fit into different environments and better survive in different situations. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Symphyta, a group of Hymenoptera that includes Xyelidae, was first found in fossil records during the Lower Triassic period. Apocrita, which includes a variety of wasps, first appeared in the Jurassic period and by the Cretaceous period, had developed into many different superfamilies. They are believed to have evolved from the Symphyta group. These insects are known by the scientific name Sphex pensylvanicus . They belong to the species of digger wasp and are known to be found across North America. The females of the species are bigger than the males of the species.The word “ sphex ” is very direct, and it is the literal word for “wasp” in Ancient Greece. The word “ pensylvanicus ” is a variation of Pennsylvania, which is an eastern state in the United States. Most often, this word is used to describe a species that is native to Pennsylvania, so it may be included in the name because there are 65 different species of great black wasps in the state. As the name suggests, the great black wasp is black. Unlike other wasps, these wasps do not have any markings or stripes on their bodies, which makes them relatively easy to identify. These insects have a traditional body for a wasp with large wings and a narrowed midsection in their small body. Their entire abdomen is a deep black hue. The female black wasp is easily the more unique of the species, showing an incredible size advantage over the male. The species often measures between 1 and 1.3 inches, though the female great wasp protects itself with a powerful and threatening stinger. These wasps appear to have a semi-gloss black appearance, made only starker by the way that the wings can fold flat onto their body. Their spiny legs can make the insect seem even more intimidating. These insects are relatively solitary, grouped with other wasps that hunt and sting. The great black wasps are subterranean insects, allowing them to make a home beneath the surface of their climate. This area is the best place for them to build a nest and care for their young. These insects are natural hunters, which is why they will go after grasshoppers , cicadas , locusts , katydids, and other fleshy insects. In some cases, these wasps will also consume their own young before they are ready to fend for themselves. As much as co-living in the environment is important, these insects could be a nuisance that is threatening your ability to safely be at home. Leaving them to thrive in the home can cause irritation or discomfort, much like the other insects that might surround you. For the most humane way to deter these bugs or a nest, a non-insecticide spray may be the best way to get rid of them. This spray stops the insect from being able to fly. There are also non-toxic mint sprays that can be used in the home and garden, protecting plants from damage as well. In some cases, it is possible to use a cleaning spray to saturate the wasps. If getting rid of it alive is not an option for you, you could hit them with a heavy object. This would most likely kill the wasp. It is important to note that flyswatters do not usually work with the great black wasps. If you are not scared of the insect, you could pick it up with the help of gloves and can push it into a fly swatter, and then take it outside your home. Interestingly, it could be difficult to determine if the wasp is dead as it can only be stunned and can still be motionless."

    "Name": "Hairy Woodpecker",
    "Diet": "Insectivore that eats insects and enjoys ants and beetle larvae",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "Listen for their energetic tapping noises. The hairy woodpecker is a small, robust bird that produces explosive calls and energetic tapping noises. You will often find them busily foraging the branches of large trees and can quickly spot them by their sounds and bold black and white patterns. These birds are endemic to North America , where they live year-round. Discover all the fascinating facts about the hairy woodpecker, including where they live and how to find them! Hairy woodpeckers are native year-round residents of Canada , the United States , Mexico , and parts of Central America. They primarily inhabit mature forests with large trees. Still, they will settle for most environments with tall trees like river groves, juniper woodlands, swamps, pine mountain forests, and Central American cloud forests. You may also spot them in suburban parks, cemeteries, beaver ponds, and orchards. To find them, scan the trunks or main branches of big trees, look for their black and white patterns, and listen for their enthusiastic tapping. Countries: Woodpeckers excavate their nesting holes in the dead stubs of trees, with the entrance hole typically on the underside, which aids in keeping out sap and flying squirrels . The entrance is approximately two inches tall and 1.5 inches wide, with a cavity 8 to 12 inches deep. The bottom of the inside is wider to allow enough room for eggs and the incubating bird. The pit is bare except for some wood chips placed on the floor. The Hairy Woodpecker’s scientific name is Leuconotopicus villosus . Leuconotopicus is a genus of woodpeckers in the family Picidae. The epithet Villosus is Latin for “hairy” or “shaggy” and refers to the unusual plumage on the hairy woodpecker’s back. There are 17 recognized subspecies of this woodpecker. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The hairy woodpecker is a medium-sized woodpecker, slightly large than a downy woodpecker. They have square heads, long bills, and long tail feathers. This bird is white underneath with a black back, wings, and tail feathers. The wings feature white checkered spots, and the head has two white stripes with a bright red patch on the back of the head in males. Its signature plumage includes a long white patch on its back. Hairy woodpeckers don’t necessarily mate for life, but they do perform courtship displays, such as duet pecking, making shrill sounds, and chasing each other around trees. Hairy woodpeckers are not migratory and take up year-round residence in their preferred environments. However, those in northern populations may wander slightly south, and birds in inland habitats might find their way towards the coast during winter. Woodpeckers that inhabit mountainous regions will travel to lower elevations during the colder months. Hairy woodpeckers are insectivores and will take advantage of overabundant pest populations. Most of this woodpecker’s diet consists of insects , which it finds by foraging on trees, turning over bark, and excavating holes. The hairy woodpecker’s favorite food is ants , beetle larvae, and moth pupae. They will also eat spiders , caterpillars , bees , wasps , crickets , millipedes , and grasshoppers . Woodpeckers are an excellent resource for controlling pests. They often move into infested areas, take residence, and eat all the critters. They are especially fond of bark beetles in live trees, wood-boring beetles in burnt forests, and coddling moths in orchards. The hairy woodpecker is a natural predator of the European corn borer, a moth that costs the US agricultural industry over $1 billion annually. About 20% of their diet comes from berries, trees, nuts, and sap. These woodpeckers also frequent backyard bird feeders filled with sunflower seeds and suet. The IUCN lists the hairy woodpecker as “least concern.” They have an increasing population and an extensive range. However, these birds are susceptible to forest fragmentation, especially giant trees in mature forests. While officials are not actively monitoring their habitats, they have in-place land and water protection. Hairy woodpeckers can fall victim to birds of prey like owls and hawks and ground animals such as bobcats , foxes , coyotes , badgers , and opossums. When they are about to be attacked, these woodpeckers will hold a frozen pose with their head, and bill pointed straight and their wings spread out horizontally. They may begin to move around the tree with their wings spread out, pecking assiduously at the bark. Males and females maintain separate territories outside the breeding season, but once it begins, they settle into the female’s territory and perform ritualized tapping at the nest site. Females lay three to six eggs. Both sexes perform incubation, with males incubating at night and females during the day. The chicks hatch after 14 days, and both parents feed them. The young leave the nest 28 to 30 days after hatching but are cared for by their parents for some time. Young hairy woodpeckers go through their first molt around 14 months and then annually after that. The IUCN estimates the hairy woodpecker population to be around 8.9 million mature individuals. Their numbers have increased by 6% over the last decade and continue to trend upward."

    "Name": "Eastern Turkey Wild Turkey",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats acorns, nuts, seeds, berries, and insects",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "“ Males have large featherless, reddish heads, necks, and wattles, with fleshy growths called caruncles. ” The eastern turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) is a large upland ground bird native to North America. It inhabits hardwood forests with scattered clearings where it spends time foraging low to the ground or roosting in flocks in tall trees. These wild birds are loud and vocal, expressing themselves with various noises. Discover all there is to know about this magnificent North American bird, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. The eastern turkey lives in North America in three countries: Canada , the United States, and Mexico. The eastern subspecies inhabits the entire eastern half of the United States from Maine to Northern Florida and as far west as Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri. Its Canadian range extends into Southeastern Ontario and Southwestern Quebec. They live in hardwood forests with scattered openings like pastures, fields, orchards, and seasonal marshes. They prefer oak-hickory, red oak, beech, cherry, and white ash in the Northeast. Look for them foraging on the ground or walking along small bushes and trees, and listen for their many vocalizations. Females search for nest sites, which are shallow dirt depressions surrounded by woody vegetation. They typically place their eggs on a pile of twigs and sticks. The eastern turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo silvestris ) is a subspecies of wild turkey from the Galliformes order, which includes heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds like turkeys, chickens , and quail. The Phasianidae family has many of the most popular game fowl. Meleagris is the turkey genus, encompassing North America’s wild turkey and Mexico’s ocellated turkey. There are six recognized subspecies of wild turkey: Eastern, Osceola, Rio Grande , Merriam’s, Gould’s, and South Mexican. Eastern turkeys are large upland ground birds, measuring 30 to 49 inches long and weighing 5.5 to 24 pounds, with a 4.1 to 4.9-foot wingspan. Females are much smaller than males, weighing eight pounds less on average. Adults have black or gray-brown feathers with a coppery sheen. Males have large featherless, reddish heads, necks, and wattles, with fleshy growths called caruncles. These parts, along with the snood (fleshly flap on the bill), become engorged when excited. They have long fan-shaped tails, and their feathers have bronze, gold, red, purple, and iridescent areas. Females have duller feathers in shades of brown and gray. Wild turkeys are loud, vocal birds who express themselves with many sounds, from gobbles, yelps, clucks, purrs, low-pitched drumming, and “spits” (sharp expulsions of air from the air sac). Their gobbles can be heard from a mile away! Despite their significant size, they are fast, agile fliers. You may see them flying under the canopy, searching for a perch, or gliding low to the ground. These birds are relatively social, roosting in flocks and foraging with other animals like deer and squirrels . Eastern turkeys are nonmigratory. They may move to areas with larger trees and closed canopies for increased warmth during the fall and winter. The eastern turkey is an omnivore who forages in the early morning and late afternoon. These wild turkeys eat acorns and nuts from various trees like hazel, chestnut, hickory, and pine. They also consume seeds, berries, buds, leaves, roots, grasses, and insects . And will occasionally eat amphibians, salamanders, snakes, and lizards . They forage on the ground or in low bushes and small trees. You can often find them feeding in cow pastures or visiting backyard feeders. The IUCN lists the eastern turkey as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and large, increasing population, this species does not meet the “threatened” status thresholds. They do not face any severe threats currently. But they may suffer from the future effects of climate change and urbanization. The eastern turkey is the most heavily hunted subspecies of wild turkey. Wild turkey eggs and nestlings are vulnerable to raccoons , opossums, skunks, foxes, groundhogs, and snakes. Poults (poultry young) can be attacked by raptors, such as owls, hawks, and bald eagles . Adult eastern turkey predators include great horned owls, northern goshawks, domestic dogs , cats, coyotes, wolves, bobcats, golden eagles, and alligators. Wild turkeys and their young often run away when threatened, but they may lash out aggressively when cornered. They can kick with their legs and use their bony spurs as weapons. They may also bite with their beaks and ram with their bodies as a last effort. Male eastern turkeys are polygamous and mate with as many hens as possible. They perform their courtship rituals during March and April while they are still flocked for winter. Males strut, gobble, boom, drum, and spit to show dominance and attract mates. Hens lay 10 to 14 whitish eggs and incubate them for 28 days. Their young, or poults, fledge the nest 12 to 24 hours after hatching. However, they stay with their mother for around four months. Males, or “toms,” become sexually mature at seven months old, and hens around one to two years. Their average lifespan is seven years, but they can survive up to 13. The global eastern turkey population is unknown, but their numbers have significantly increased in North America over the last 40 years. They are also not experiencing extreme fluctuations or fragmentations in their populations. Sources:"

    "Name": "White Crowned Sparrow",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats seeds, vegetation, and insects",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "“They have different song dialects and prefer to sing the one they grew up with.” The white-crowned sparrow ( Zonotrichia leucophrys) is a medium-sized New World sparrow native to North America. It inhabits alpine meadows and tundra in Alaska and Northern Canada but chooses to stay in thickets and backyards in its US and Mexico wintering homes. These birds have interesting songs, can fly long distances, and have social personalities. Discover everything there is to know about the white-crowned sparrow! The white-crowned sparrow lives in at least five countries in North America, including Canada , the United States , Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Some populations are year-round residents in their Pacific Coast homes in the US, while those who breed in Alaska and Northern Canada migrate south to the United States and Mexico. They inhabit open spaces like tundra, alpine meadows, and forest edges during breeding. In the winter, you can find them in thickets, backyards, and agricultural fields. Look for them hopping about on the ground or tree branches, often in flocks during the winter. And listen for their sweet whistles. The nest is placed on the ground in a shallow depression near the base of shrubs or grass in the northern regions. Populations further south tend to put theirs in shrubs a few feet off the ground. Females build the nest by forming an open cup made of grass, twigs, weeds, and bark. They line the inside with soft grass, feathers, and animal hair. The white-crowned sparrow ( Zonotrichia leucophrys ) is from the Passerellidae family, a group of New World passerine birds. Its genus, Zonotrichia, contains five American sparrows, four of which are in North America . Zonotrichia is Ancient Greek for “band” and “hair,” and Leucophrys means “white” and “eyebrow.” There are five recognized subspecies of white-crowned sparrows. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The white-crowned sparrow is a medium-sized New World sparrow featuring a small bill and a long tail. They measure 5.9 to 6.3 inches long and weigh 0.9 to one ounce, with an 8.3 to 9.4-inch wingspan. Their wings and upper body parts are brown and heavily streaked, while their undersides are gray. They have black and white stripes on their heads, gray faces, and pink or yellow bills. These sparrows spend their days hopping around on branches or the ground near bushes and trees. They are relatively social, forming pairs during the breeding season and foraging in flocks in winter. They are strong fliers that can travel 300 miles in one night! Their songs are thin, sweet whistles followed by buzzy notes. Males learn distinct songs from the community they grew up in and continue to sing in the same dialect as adults. Some males can be bilingual, singing in two dialects. White-crowned sparrows are residents or medium-distance migrants. Those that breed in Alaska and Northern Canada migrate to most of the US and Mexico during winter. Populations along the US Pacific Coast and the interior west stay year-round in their environments. White-crowned sparrows are omnivores who forage in flocks. They primarily eat seeds, vegetation, and insects. This sparrow mainly eats weed and grass seeds during the winter and insects and spiders in the summer. Throughout most seasons, they feed on buds, moss, flowers, berries, and small pieces of fruit. They forage in flocks outside the nesting season and find their food by hopping and running on the ground. Occasionally, you will find them in low-lying shrubs or mid-air as they jump out to catch flying insects. The IUCN lists the white-crowned sparrow as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and extremely large and stable population, this species does not meet the thresholds for “threatened” status. While nothing immediate threatens their population, the white-crowned sparrow could suffer the effects of climate change in the future. They are highly susceptible to habitat loss from wildfires and endangered young from spring heat waves. Their primary predators include large birds like crows , jays, owls, and hawks. Snakes are also known to steal eggs from their nest. These sparrows are naturally alert birds who rely on camouflage and their flying ability to defend themselves most of the time. Males are typically more aggressive towards different bird species than their own. They may fly towards intruders with their crown feathers erect and chest puffed out while singing loudly. White-crowned sparrows are monogamous during the breeding season, and some may partner with the same mate during the following season. Females lay between two and six (four to five on average) pale green eggs with reddish brown spots. Females incubate by themselves for 11 to 14 days, and both parents assist in feeding the nestlings (mainly insects). The young fledge the nest seven to twelve days after hatching, but the males continue to care for them while the females begin their second nesting attempt. Populations in the northern regions typically only lay one breed per year, but those further south can have up to four. These sparrows are sexually mature by one-year-old. They have an average lifespan of 2.6 years in the wild but can live up to 13. The global white-crowned sparrow population is estimated to number 79 million mature individuals. From 1970 to 2017, their population underwent a slight decline of 0.3% per year. However, their numbers have been considered stable for the last ten years, with no extreme fluctuations or fragmentations."

    "Text": "“A Blue-gray gnatcatcher can snatch insects out of mid-air” One of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher’s most notable features is the cap of deep blue feathers on its head. Another notable feature is a call that sounds like spee, spee! Blue-gray gnatcatchers live in open woods, scrubs, and thickets. Flies, small wasps, beetles , and spiders are all in its diet. The Blue-gray gnatcatcher is native to North America and lives in a temperate climate. These birds are year-round residents in many states along the southern coast of the United States . This range includes the southern part of California traveling east to Florida and up into southern parts of Georgia and South Carolina . Some are permanent residents of Mexico and Cuba as well. There are some Blue-gray gnatcatchers that make their home in northern parts of the United States. But birds living in northern states such as Michigan and Wisconsin migrate south for the winter. Sometimes they travel as far as Mexico. These birds start migrating south in September. The breeding season for this bird runs from March or April into late July. This is a great time to see these birds at work building nests and feeding their chicks. So, if you see a couple of Blue-gray gnatcatchers building a nest remember that joy and happiness are two words in the spiritual meaning of this feathered creature. In the springtime, the male Blue-gray gnatcatcher sings its song to attract females to the area. Once he finds a mate, nest construction begins. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The nest design is a cup shape made with mud , grass, and twigs. Animal hair and grass are put on the inside of the nest to serve as a soft layer for the eggs. Both male and female Blue-gray gnatcatchers work together to apply a layer of spider webs and lichen to the exterior of the nest. This helps hide it from predators. These birds usually build their nest at a height of 20 to 40 feet in a tree. Polioptila caerulea is the scientific name of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher. The Greek word Polioptila means gray plumage and the word caerulea means blue. It’s in the Aves class and the Polioptilidae family. Well, the name of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher says a lot about the appearance and behavior of this bird. Yes, this bird has bluish-gray feathers on its back and wings along with a cap of deeper blue feathers on its head. Its breast is white. Blue-gray gnatcatchers have a long, thin, pointed beak. Its beak design allows it to pluck an insect out of the air. Capturing insects in mid-air is called hawking. Its long tail feathers contain both black and white feathers. This bird flicks its tail feathers side to side to frighten insects out of bushes. Male Blue-gray gnatcatchers are larger than females. Plus, a male has a black stripe extending from the base of its beak, over each eye, and across each side of its head. The length of a Blue-gray gnatcatcher is four to five inches, and its height is three to four inches. It’s very light, weighing just .21 ounces. The wingspan of this bird is 6.3 inches. The dark color of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher gives it an advantage when it’s trying to blend into its wooded habitat. The thin, pointed beak of this bird helps it to get a firm hold on its prey. The Blue-gray gnatcatcher covers the outside of its nest with spider webs and lichen. Once again, this is an attempt to hide the nest from snakes, hawks, and other predators able to get into the treetops to kill an adult bird or steal an egg. This bird uses its call to warn other Blue-gray gnatcatchers of predators. Blue-gray gnatcatchers living in the northern parts of the United States migrate south to warmer weather for the winter season. In late September, birds living in Michigan, Wisconsin, southern Montana, and other northern states start on a southward path. Some of these birds stay in southern states such as Florida, Georgia, or Texas for the winter. Other Blue-gray gnatcatchers travel further south into Mexico. In the spring, these migratory birds fly north again for the breeding season starting in March or April. Does a Blue-gray gnatcatcher look like a carnivore to you? It is! In fact, some biologists call this bird an insectivore because of its diet of insects. This bird eats flies , leafhoppers, small wasps , spiders, and caterpillars . Along with capturing insects in mid-air, they also hop along the branches of a tree looking for bugs on leaves. One interesting behavior of this bird is it will pick up a leaf-covered twig and shake it. This is an effort to scare the insects out from beneath the leaves. This tiny bird has lots of predators including snakes , hawks , kestrels , and cats . All of these animals are able to chase after Blue-gray gnatcatchers even if they try to escape into the trees. Loss of habitat is an issue for Blue-gray gnatcatchers, but it’s not considered of major concern. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reports this bird as Least Concern with a population that is rising. Male Blue-gray gnatcatchers attract females with their song. A male and female Blue-gray gnatcatcher pair up during the breeding season. However, biologists aren’t sure whether they stay together for life. These birds begin breeding in March or April. A female has four or five eggs that hatch in just 13 days. Both the male and the female take turns going out to find food for their babies, or chicks. The chicks grow quickly and are able to leave the nest at about 14 or 15 days old. Typically, these birds live up to four years of age. But there is one Blue-gray gnatcatcher on record as having lived four years, two months! Despite not having a specific population listed on their IUCN Red List of Threatened Species page, this bird is thought to be of Least Concern. Furthermore, its numbers are estimated to be on the rise."

    "Name": "Woodrat",
    "Diet": "Herbivore that eats insects",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "“The woodrat is the collector of bright and shiny objects.” The woodrat, also called the packrat or the trade rat, is famous for picking up or even stealing man-made objects and using them to build its nests and dens. The accumulated trash thrown out of these dens over time can tell scientists the history of a place. Here are four facts about the packrat: Packrats belong to the Neotoma genus. Neotoma comes from the Greek words for “new,” neos , and “cut,” tomos . So, Neotoma refers to a new mammal with teeth that cut. Originally, packrats were placed in the Mus genus, which simply means mouse. Species are: Some of these species have subspecies. For example, the desert woodrat, N. lepida has 23 subspecies. The packrat resembles the Norway rat that’s often seen in cities but is somewhat more aesthetically pleasing. Its fur ranges from cinnamon to grayish-brown to brown, and its undersides are always white or light gray. The packrat’s eyes are large and dark, and one means of identification is its tail. The trade rat’s tail is furry, while the city rat’s tail is scaly. It can be nearly as bushy as a squirrel’s. T See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . he packrat has a long body and large, round ears. Its size depends largely on its location, for packrats from warmer climates tend to be smaller than those from cold climates. Hence, the bushy-tailed woodrat is the largest of these rodents and is found as far north as Canada’s Yukon Territory. Packrats range from 10 to 18.5 inches in length and weigh between 9.5 to 14 ounces, though some individuals are larger. Male packrats are larger than females. Woodrats are solitary and only come together to mate. The only other type of group behavior involves a mother and her pups. Most species appear to be nocturnal though it’s not unheard of to see some types of woodrat, such as the white-throated woodrat, being active during the day. Identification of a packrat, as opposed to another rodent, also comes from their habit of building nests and dens out of all manner of materials, including plant material, bones, feathers, animal feces, and man-made objects. Indeed, if a packrat is carrying a twig and finds a shiny penny in its path, it will drop the twig, pick up the penny and take it to add to its nest. This is how they get their other name of trader rat. Packrats communicate with each other through their scent glands, which are especially well-developed in males. Their scent glands are found in the middle of their bellies, and they drag themselves over the ground to lay down their scent. Their feces also have pheromones that allow the identification of males and females. Packrats tend to be aggressive in defending their territory. Because packrats don’t hibernate, they cache food in different locations around their territories. Woodrats are also famous for middens, which can be enormous and tens of thousands of years old. They are not dens or nests, though nests and dens are built within them. Nests are kept clean and tidy, but middens have years, centuries, and millennia of waste products that scientists use rather like time machines to determine how the climate has changed and the types of plants that used to grow in the area. Packrats are native to North America, and biologists believe they have been on the continent for tens of thousands of years just from the age of the oldest middens. They build their nests and dens in dese rts beneath spiny cacti, in caves, on cliffs, up in trees, in houses where people live, and in abandoned buildings and mines. They’re found in the woods, chaparral, on mountain ridges, and near bodies of water, including lakes rivers, and oceans. Some dens passed down from mother to daughter, as can be seen in the big-eared woodrat. Packrats are herbivores and eat acorns, leaves, pine needles, seeds, and succulents. A few species are specialists and only eat juniper, yucca, and certain species of cacti. As a rat, the packrat has a variety of predators, including skunks , weasels , owls, coyotes , black bears , foxes , snakes , and humans . Many species of packrats, including the Allegheny woodrat, are subject to diseases. The Allegheny woodrat’s population seems to be negatively affected by the raccoon roundworm. Packrats are also hosts to ticks, mites, fleas , roundworms, and botflies. The mating rituals of these little mammals are mysterious to biologists, but a lot of species fight before they mate. These are not play fights. The male and female packrat will stand on their hind legs and box like kangaroos and bite and scratch each other. It is not unusual for one or both to be injured, and if the female is bigger and stronger, the male can be killed. It seems the pair mates when they get tired of fighting. Mating happens quickly in most species because the pair is vulnerable to predation when they’re in the act. Afterward, the male leaves and attempts to breed with another female. The breeding season for some packrats is in spring and summer, though it is the fall for the Allegheny woodrat and from February to August for the eastern woodrat. The female is pregnant for a little over a month. The size of the litter ranges from one to six babies, even though the packrat has only four teats. The babies are hairless and blind. At this stage, they’re called “pinkies.” Their eyes open when they’re about two weeks old, and they’re weaned after bout a month. The males leave when they’re about two and a half months old, but the females often share territories with their mother, and as stated daughters inherit their mother’s dens in some species. Mothers and daughters may also use the same food caches. The pups are sexually mature when they’re about two months old, but they don’t breed until they’re a year old. The lifespan of a packrat rarely lasts as long as five years, and most have a lifespan of less than three. The entire population is believed to turn around every eight years. Interestingly, some species of packrats are not as prolific breeders as other types of rats and mice . The Allegheny woodrat can have two or three litters of two pups every year, which is a low birth rate. The overall packrat population is undetermined, but there are at least hundreds of thousands. Some species are of least concern but others are in decline and considered vulnerable. For example, the Allegheny woodrat is considered endangered in some of its range, although its population is estimated at around 100,000. Subspecies of the eastern woodrat are considered endangered or threatened in Key Largo, Florida , North Carolina , and Tennessee ."

    "Name": "Common Grackle",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, small fish, rodents, frogs, lizards, and eggs",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "“T heir wintering flocks can grow to over one million individuals. ” The common grackle ( Quiscalus quiscula) is a large blackbird native to North America , where it lives as a resident or short-term migrant in Canada, the United States , and Mexico. This species inhabits open country areas like groves, farmlands, and woodland edges. These gregarious birds are highly social and loud, chattering to one another as they perch atop trees and power lines. Discover all there is to know about the common grackle, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. Common grackles live in North America in five countries, including Canada , the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. This bird is a permanent resident in most of its range, but the northern populations migrate to the southern US during winter. These grackles prefer open to semi-open country areas, such as farmlands, groves, woodland edges, marshes, agricultural fields, suburbs, pastures, and towns. Look for them in large mixed-species flocks, foraging on the ground or in shallow water. You may hear these raucous birds before you see them. Grackles nest in communities from 10 pairs up to 100 or more. They nest in areas with dense trees near open spaces, such as parks , woodlands edges, and groves. Females build a bulky open cup nest made with twigs, mud, and grass, lined with fine grass. She hides it in vegetation near water, around 20 feet above the ground. The common grackle ( Quiscalus quiscula) is from the Passeriformes order in the Icteridae family, encompassing New World blackbirds. The Quiscalus genus contains seven of the eleven grackle species. The common grackle has three recognized subspecies: the purple, Florida, and bronzed grackles. The common grackle is a New World blackbird, measuring 11 to 13 inches and weighing 2.6 to 5 ounces, with a 14 to 18-inch wingspan. They have long bills, long tails, bright golden eyes, and flat heads. Adults have glossy purple heads, and their bodies are a bronze sheen. Females are smaller, have shorter tails, and are less iridescent in color. Juveniles are browner with dark eyes. Grackles are highly social, congregating in large flocks to nest, forage, and fly. They may nest with other bird species, and their wintering flocks can grow to over one million individuals. These birds are also known for being loud, often clucking, screeching, and chattering with each other as they sit atop trees and power lines. These blackbirds are known to be bullies as they push other species out of the way while feeding at bird feeders. Outside their courtship aerial displays, grackles fly in a straight path with stiff wingbeats, reaching speeds up to 39 Mph. The common grackle is a resident to short-term migrant in its range. They live year-round in the southeastern half of the United States. But populations that breed in the Northern US and Canada migrate to the Central and Southern US during the winter, occasionally reaching Mexico and the Bahamas. Common grackles are omnivores who forage on the ground or in shallow water. They primarily eat insects but will also consume small fish , rodents, frogs, lizards, eggs, and young of other birds. Their insect diet includes beetles , grasshoppers, caterpillars, spiders, millipedes, and worms. They supplement their diet in winter with berries, seeds, grains, and acorns. The common grackle forages on the ground, in shallow water, or shrubs and trees. They feed in flocks and occasionally steal food and eggs from other birds. You may also see this species at backyard feeders. The IUCN lists the common grackle as NC or “near threatened.” This species is undergoing a continuous decline in its population. However, the reduction seems to be slowing, and their population is more extensive than previously suspected, so the status is precautionarily listed as near threatened . The common grackle is a significant pest species due to its propensity for damaging grains, seeds, and fruit. It also spreads the fatal human respiratory disease histoplasmosis. Consequently, this grackle is the subject of population control and other deterrent measures. Grackle predators include domestic cats , raccoons, hawks, and owls. Squirrels and snakes are their primary nest predators who steal and eat their eggs and young. Males stand guard at their nests, and both sexes actively defend their site by mobbing, chasing, or diving at intruders. Common grackles are typically monogamous and form breeding pairs in the spring. Courtship involves singing, posturing, and flight displays. Females lay an average of four to five pale blue eggs with brown blotches. Only the females incubate the eggs for 12 to 14 days, but both parents feed the nestlings (mainly insects). The young fledge the nest 16 to 20 days after hatching and reach sexual maturity around one year. They have an average lifespan of 5.6 years but can live up to 23 years in the wild. The common grackle global population is estimated to number 69 million mature individuals. Despite its significant population, this species has undergone over a 60% decrease in North America over the last 40 years. However, researchers do not suspect future declines in this bird. Its primary reason for the decline is due to population control efforts."

    "Name": "Red Winged Blackbird",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats seeds, grains, nuts, insects, snails, frogs",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "The red-winged blackbird is found almost everywhere across North America except for deserts and mountains. The male is easily identified by the black glossy feathers and red shoulder patches. Its rich song can be heard every year beginning in the spring. It has also been known to attack people who wander too close to its territory. The red-winged blackbird is native to North America . Depending on the time of the year, it may be found anywhere from Alaska to the Caribbean and Central America . This species lives in a variety of different habits, including open fields and sparse deciduous forests, but its favorite habitat is fresh and saltwater marshes and wetlands. The red-winged blackbird constructs its nests in rushes, grasses, cattails, sedges, or other tall vegetation. The nest itself is made out of grasses and mosses lined with mud and branches. The scientific name of the red-winged blackbird is Agelaius phoeniceus . The genus name is derived from an ancient Greek word meaning gregarious; if you’re not familiar with this term, it describes the bird’s highly social behavior. The species name of phoeniceus is a Latin term meaning crimson or red. This species is closely related to other types of American blackbirds. The red-winged blackbird is characterized by a stout body, broad shoulders, and a slender cone-shaped bill. Like many other songbirds, there is a strong element of sexual dimorphism, meaning the sexes vary dramatically in appearance. The male is covered in glossy black feathers with red and yellow around the shoulders. This patch is thought to an adaptation that can puff up when feeling confident or threatened. It might even be a signal of the male’s aggressive levels. The female, by contrast, is characterized by brown plumage with dark stripes on the underside and white eyebrow markings. While the male is slightly larger, the average length of this species is 7 to 8 inches with a 12 to 15-inch wingspan. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The red-winged blackbird is a highly social species that roost and travels together in large groups. During the day, these groups break up to forage for food and then reform at night. Their behavior changes slightly in the mating season when a male will become a little more aggressive in the defense of its territory and its mates. It has been to attack much larger animals such as humans that encroach on its territory. While both sexes make a variety of different calls to communicate, the male is the only one capable of producing songs; one of the most important adaptations for attracting mates. They learn this song from other males as a juvenile. This species is also quite fast and agile in the air, flying at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Northern populations of the red-winged blackbird migrate in flocks of thousands for the winter toward the southern United States and Central America . Western and southern populations tend to remain in the same place year-round. The red-winged blackbird has an omnivorous diet. It will spend most of the day foraging on the ground and in trees. The red-winged blackbird will consume almost anything it can find, including seeds, nuts, grains, insects (like flies and butterflies ), snails , frogs , and carrion. The red-winged blackbird is considered to be a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. The biggest threat to this species over the last few centuries has been the loss of wetlands to make way for homes and buildings. Like many songbirds, it has adapted well to live near people, but this has sometimes led to accidents and clashes. While the bird is supposed to be protected by the US Migratory Treaty Act, it is sometimes deliberately hunted or poisoned. Natural predation and disease have also led to many premature deaths every year. The red-winged blackbird is preyed upon by raccoons , minks , owls, wrens, magpies , and birds of prey. It has evolved several adaptations to deal with predators, including the ability to conceal its nest in tall vegetation and roost in large groups. The blackbird’s mating season usually lasts between early spring and mid-summer. The male bird has evolved adaptations to initiate courtship with his elaborate song and a visual display involving the flapping of wings. A single male will normally have about five females in his territory to mate with. He is quite aggressive about defending his territory and will attack anyone who comes within the boundaries. The nest is built at some point in March to May (or even earlier in the south) near a marsh or other moist area. After copulating, the female will produce three to seven eggs per clutch with multiple clutches per breeding season. The development of the young is very rapid. The chicks hatch after about a week and start flying in 10 to 14 days. By the two or three week mark, they are already independent. The female bears most of the responsibility for raising the young, but the male does take part in feeding them when the mother is absent and also defending the territory. Due to predation and disease, the red-winged blackbird only lives for an average of about two years in the wild. If it can avoid an early death, then it has a more reasonable lifespan. The oldest known member of this species lived nearly 16 years. The IUCN Red List currently estimates that there are 210 million individual red-winged blackbirds alive in the wild today. However, numbers appear to be in decline."

    "Name": "Evening Grosbeak",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats seeds, berries, buds, fruit, sap, and insects and enjoys box elder, ash, maple",
    "Location": "North America",
    "Text": "“Evening grosbeaks are common at backyard feeders.” The evening grosbeak ( Hesperiphona vespertina) is a large, heavyset bird with a thick conical bill native to North America. It inhabits coniferous forests in Canada and the Northern United States and frequents much of the US’s urban and suburban areas during the winter. Look to the tops of trees where they forage for food and listen for their short whistles and sparrow-like calls. Discover this fascinating North American bird , including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. The evening grosbeak lives in North America in three countries, including the United States , Canada, and Mexico. They live year-round in Southern Canada and the Pacific Northwest in the United States. Some populations migrate for the winter by moving south into much of the US and some parts of Mexico. They breed in mature coniferous forests , mainly spruce-fir, pine-oak, and aspen. Wintering grosbeaks live in coniferous and deciduous forests, suburbs, and urban areas . Migratory birds often spend much of their time at backyard feeders. Be sure to leave out sunflower seeds on a platform feeder to attract them to your yard! Females build their nests on a horizontal tree branch away from the trunk or on a vertical fork, up to 100 feet above the ground. The nest is a loosely constructed cup made of twigs and lined with grass, moss, and pine needles. The evening grosbeak ( Hesperiphona vespertina) is in the Fringillidae family, encompassing the true finches, small to medium-sized birds with stout conical-shaped beaks. Its genus, Hesperiphona, also comprises the finches. Its specific name, Vespertina, is Latin for “evening.” The evening grosbeak is a large, chunky bird with thick conical bills. They measure 6.3 to 7.1 inches long and weigh 1.9 to 2.6 ounces, with an 11.8 to 14.2-inch wingspan. This bird also has a short tail, a broad chest, and a thick neck. Adult males have bright yellow foreheads and bodies, with a brown head and a large white patch on its wing. Females are olive-brown with gray underparts. Both sexes feature black tails and wings and pale bills. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These grosbeaks are social birds often found in flocks, especially in winter. They break off into small groups and pairs during the breeding season. They are friendly with those in their species and show very little aggression toward one another. This species also does not defend its feeding territories due to the abundance of food in its habitats. Their songs are short, with musical whistles, and their calls sound like a house sparrow . Evening grosbeaks are residents to irregular migrants. Populations in Southern Canada and the Pacific Northwest in the United States live year-round in their environments. Other northern populations will only migrate when cone crops in coniferous forests are low. They typically only migrate further south into the United States and Mexico every two to three years. Evening grosbeaks are omnivores that feed on the tops of trees and shrubs. Most of their diet comes from seeds, especially box elder, ash, and maple. They also eat berries, buds, small fruit, weed seeds, maple sap, and insects . This bird consumes gravel for minerals and frequently graces backyard feeders with sunflower seeds. They forage on the tops of trees and shrubs and occasionally on the ground. They forage in flocks outside of the nesting season. The IUCN lists the evening grosbeak as VU or “vulnerable.” Their range and population are still relatively large, but studies suggest this species is on a steep and rapid decline. There doesn’t appear to be one specific cause for this decline; there are likely many causes. Their most significant threats include urbanization, the logging industry, invasive species, and pollution. These birds are also susceptible to the effects of climate change and may suffer from spring heat waves and wildfires in the future. The most significant predator of the evening grosbeak is domestic cats. But they may fall victim to jays, hawks, grackles, and squirrels . This species is not particularly quarrelsome but may give alarm calls to warn of intruders. While they are not aggressive birds, they will chase away woodpeckers , cowbirds, and robins. Evening grosbeaks form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and mate quietly without producing elaborate songs and displays. Males occasionally perform a little vibrating dance during courtship. Females lay between two and five (three to four on average) pale blue-green eggs with brown, purple, or gray blotches. They incubate for 11 to 13 days while the males bring them food. Both parents feed the nestling, and the young fledge the nest around two weeks after hatching. This species produces one to two broods per year. They live an average of 5.5 years but can reach up to 16. The global evening grosbeak population is estimated to number 3.4 million mature individuals. Despite its seemingly large population, this grosbeak has undergone a significant and steep decline in North America over the last 40 years. Some research suggests their numbers have decreased by 94% since 1970. Scientists have not yet identified the reason for its steep decline. However, many factors can contribute."

    "Name": "Orchard Oriole",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, spiders, pollen, nectar, berries, and flowers",
    "Location": "North America, South America",
    "Text": "“ They are easy-going birds who show little aggression toward other bird species. ” The orchard oriole ( Icterus spurius) is a small passerine bird native to North and South America, inhabiting orchards and woodland edges. These social birds are easy-going and show little aggression, often joining mixed-species groups. Listen for the male’s rapid musical songs during spring when he courts his mate. Discover all the interesting facts about this oriole, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. Orchard orioles live in North and South America in 14 countries, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Bolivia. They spend their springs and summers in the eastern half of the United States and central Mexico, migrating mid-summer to their wintering grounds in Central America and the northern tip of South America (Colombia, Venezuela). Their breeding habitats include semi-open areas, such as orchards and wood edges; they winter in the lowland tropic’s brushy areas. They may also inhabit suburbs, prairie groves, and riverside trees. They nest in deciduous trees or tall shrubs in the fork of a horizontal branch, sometimes around clumps of Spanish moss. Females build hanging baskets made from grass and plant fiber and lined with fine grass and plant down. The orchard oriole ( Icterus spurius) belongs to the Passeriformes order in the Icteridae family, which encompasses the New World blackbirds. The Icterus genus includes the New World orioles and is sometimes mistaken for New World warblers. There are three recognized subspecies of orchard oriole. The orchard oriole is a small passerine bird, measuring 5.9 to 7.1 inches and weighing 0.6 to 1.0 ounces, with a 9.8-inch wingspan. They have sharply pointed bills, medium-length tails, and round heads. Adult males have chestnut underparts and rumps, and the remaining plumage is black. They also have black bills and white wingbars. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This species is relatively social, forming pairs during the breeding season and foraging and roosting in groups during the winter. They are easy-going birds who show little aggression toward other bird species. Males are most vocal during the spring, and their songs are rapid, musical warbles similar to a purple finch. They are light, agile fliers that produce rapid wingbeats and may hover over foliage to search for food. Orchard orioles are long-distance migrants, arriving on their breeding grounds in late May and leaving by mid-July. They breed in the eastern half of the United States and central Mexico, migrating through northern Mexico and northern Central America before reaching their wintering grounds in Central America and the northern tip of South America. The orchard oriole is an omnivore who primarily eats insects but supplements with fruit and plant material. Their diet consists of beetles , grasshoppers, caterpillars, spiders , wasps, ants, nectar, pollen, berries, and parts of flowers. They mainly eat insects during the summer but supplement with berries, nectar, and other plant material during the winter. They forage among the foliage of trees and bushes, probing flower blossoms and snatching insects. This species feeds in flocks during winter. The IUCN lists the orchard oriole as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and very large, stable population, this species does not meet “threatened” status thresholds. However, these birds still face threats in certain parts of their range, such as habitat loss, cowbird parasitism, and overgrazing which destroys shrub vegetation. Their predators include crows, owls , squirrels, foxes, and domestic cats. These predators typically target their eggs and young, but parents will defend their nests. Orioles use alarm calls to warn of potential danger and will mob intruders who get too close. Orchard orioles form monogamous pairs during the spring but will change partners each year. This species is not very territorial, and more than one pair may nest in the same tree. Females lay an average of four to five pale bluish-white eggs with brown and gray spots. She incubates them for 12 to 15 days while males bring food. Both parents feed the nestlings, and the young fledge the nest 11 to 14 days after hatching, but they remain with one or both parents for several more weeks. They become sexually mature and acquire their adult plumage around two years and live an average of five years. The global orchard oriole population is unknown, but they have had stable numbers in North America for the last 40 years. They are not experiencing any extreme fluctuations or fragmentations in their population."

    "Name": "Egyptian Goose",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, frogs, terrestrial worms",
    "Location": "Africa, Asia, Europe, North America",
    "Text": "Despite its name, the Egyptian Goose is a type of duck prominently featured in ancient Egyptian art. These birds have a natural range around the Nile River; however, their range has extended outside Egypt , with populations as far away as Florida in the United States . These birds are seldom migratory and have a diet that includes plants and insects. Their signature style includes mask-like markings. On average, most females lay five up to a dozen eggs. The most common place to see the Egyptian Goose is in its native Egypt , where the species has the most nests, as well as in southern Israel . Although native to the Nile River area, these birds also have populations coming from escaped pets as far away as South Africa , the United Kingdom , and the states of Florida , California , and Texas in the United States . These birds spend most of their time swimming in their habitat but will roost in trees or forage for food inshore areas. These birds will stay in the area unless drought conditions force them out, so you can usually find them all year long. Originating from Africa , this peculiar goose species has gained popularity in zoos and aviaries. Notably, escaped individuals have successfully established wild populations in Florida, Texas, and California, while occasional sightings of free-flying escapees occur in other regions as well. Originating from sub-tropical Africa, the Egyptian goose was introduced to Britain during the late 17th century, primarily as an ornamental bird intended for adorning the lakes of country gentlemen. While Canadian geese are typically indigenous to the Arctic and temperate areas of North America, their migratory routes have been observed to extend to northern Europe. On the other hand, Egyptian geese are naturally found in Africa, specifically in regions south of the Sahara and along the Nile Valley. Egyptian Geese make nests with participation from the female and the male. Hollowed-out tree cavities are preferred spots, but the birds will often use a location on the ground. Grasses and leaves are preferred nesting materials combined with a lining of feathers for extra warmth when the chicks hatch. The Egyptian Goose, sometimes known as the Nile Goose, has a Latin or scientific name of Alopochen aegyptiaca . This bird is part of the Aves class and Anatidae family, which makes it most closely related to other ducks, geese, and swans . The Egyptian Goose boasts a 25-29 in. wingspan and approximate length, giving the bird an impressive appearance in flight. These birds also have a weight range of 2.2 to 8.8 lbs. The male is larger than the female on average, but both genders share a similar appearance otherwise. Mostly brown coloring helps this bird blend in with the grass in river areas. The majority of the bird’s coloring is a lighter shade of brown. However, darker brown markings around the eyes give the appearance of a bandit’s mask. In some cases, these birds have been domesticated and kept as pets , with the ancient Egyptians being among one of the first groups to tame these birds. Although these birds are often friendly in captivity, they are territorial in their natural habitat, driving other animals away from their nesting areas. Unlike many other waterfowl species, these birds are not usually migratory except in the case of a drought. The Egyptian Goose eats aquatic plants and leaves, including grass, herb, flower seeds, and shoots. When these birds consume animal protein, they eat worms, insects , and tiny frogs . Some threats in their native range include habitat loss because of agricultural practices and climate change . The bird’s endangered status may change because the population numbers are not as well-documented as some other species. Many of these birds have been kept as pets and escaped into non-native locations like Florida and other parts of the United States. People in these areas consider the birds invasive because they can establish breeding populations and live long lifespans with good food sources. The perception of these birds as being invasive motivates a lot of hunting, making humans a legitimate threat. Predators that prey on the Egyptian Goose include Sea Eagles and, in the case of U.S. populations, Red-Tailed Hawks . These birds attack Egyptian Geese in the air or while roosting in trees, using their talons and beaks to deliver a fatal blow. Leopards are also natural predators, stalking and pouncing to kill with a bite to the neck. Besides trying to blend in with their surroundings, Egyptian Geese have also developed diversionary tactics to lead leopards and similar predators away. One of these techniques involves feigning injury to keep predators away from nests. Egyptian Geese pair for life, with females laying 5-12 eggs. Females usually lay their eggs around March, with incubation lasting 28 to 30 days. The babies will fledge or get ready to leave the nest at about 70 days after hatching. Molting usually happens a little later, around 10-12 weeks. These birds have Least Concern status. Although the exact number in the wild is unknown, observed wild populations have remained stable. Breeding populations in areas outside Egypt have shown modest growth, with ducklings spotted with their mothers in Florida."

    "Name": "Swainsons Hawk 2",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats small mammals, reptiles, and large insects",
    "Location": "North America, South America",
    "Text": "“ Swainson’s hawks are long-distance migrants, and almost the entire population moves from North America to South America during August and September. ” The Swainson’s hawk ( Buteo swainsoni) is a medium-sized raptor native to North and South America. They live in open areas with scattered thickets of trees, like grasslands and prairies. They spend their days soaring low to the ground or perched on fence posts and utility poles, searching for prey. These long-distance migrants make an arduous journey from Canada and the Northern United States to Argentina each year. Learn everything there is to know about this bird of prey, including where they live, what they eat, and how they behave. Swainson’s hawks live in North and South America in 19 countries, including Canada, the United States , Mexico, Costa Rica, and Argentina. They are long-distance migrants who move from North America to South America during late summer. They inhabit open areas like grasslands, savannas, plains, farmlands, and cultivated lands. This bird only requires a small thicket of trees for nesting. Look for them soaring in flocks, perched on posts, or scattered on the ground, looking for food. They nest in prairie regions with scattered trees, where they typically place their nests well-hidden by vegetation. Occasionally, they nest on old magpie nests, cliffs, ledges, steep slopes, or tall shrubs. They construct a platform of sticks and leafy green branches and line the inside with weeds. The Swainson’s hawk ( Buteo swainsoni) is from the Accipitriformes order in the Accipitridae family, encompassing small to large birds with strongly hooked bills. The Buteo genus includes wide-ranging raptors called “buzzards” or “hawks.” This species is monotypic, meaning there are no subspecies of the Swainson’s hawk. The Swainson’s hawk is a medium-sized raptor, measuring 17 to 22 inches long and weighing 1.1 to 3.7 pounds, with a 46 to 54-inch wingspan. They have slim bodies and long wings, which they hold in a “V” shape when soaring. They also have a hooked bill and a fan-shaped tail. And they have light undersides with reddish-brown breasts and brown or gray upper parts. Their flight feathers are black, and they have distinctive white wing linings. Males have gray heads, and females have brown heads. Some species are darker and can be reddish to almost all black. These birds are social, forming monogamous pair bonds and joining small groups outside the breeding season. You will often find them soaring in flocks or perched on fence posts and utility poles. Occasionally, they sit scattered on the ground. These hawks are not overly noisy but give a hoarse scream (“kreeee”) when perched or in flight. They soar on rising air currents with their tails and wings spread wide. Swainson’s hawks are long-distance migrants, and almost the entire population moves from North America to South America during August and September. They breed in the western half of the United States and Canada and migrate through Mexico, Central America , and Northern South America before reaching their wintering grounds in Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil. They travel a total of 12,000 miles during their journey. Swainson’s hawks are carnivores who hunt by soaring low over grasslands. Their diet consists of small mammals , reptiles, and large insects. They feed their young squirrels, gophers , small birds, mice, snakes, and lizards. They occasionally eat bats and carrion. In late summer, they rely heavily on grasshoppers and caterpillars. They hunt by perching and scanning the ground or soaring low over grasslands. They can also run on the ground, searching for insects. The IUCN lists the Swainson’s hawk as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and large, stable population, this species does not meet the “threatened” status thresholds. The biggest threat to this hawk is their loss of foraging and breeding grounds due to urbanization. They may also be susceptible to the future effects of climate change, such as spring heat waves and wildfires. Swainson’s hawks have very few natural predators, but their nests can become vulnerable to certain species, such as great horned owls, coyotes , golden eagles, and bobcats. These hawks are highly aggressive when defending their nests and typically have no problems driving off intruders and potential predators . These hawks are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds, and their courtship involves aerial displays. Females lay two to three dull white eggs and incubate them for 34 to 35 days, while they may bring food. Both parents assist in feeding their chicks, and young fledge the nest 42 to 44 days after hatching but may remain with their parents until the fall migration. This species reaches sexual maturity around two years and has an average lifespan of 10 years, but it can live over 24 years. The global Swainson’s hawk population is unknown, but they’ve had stable population trends in North America for the last 40 years. They are not experiencing any extreme fluctuations or fragmentations in their numbers. Sources:"

    "Name": "Upland Sandpiper",
    "Diet": "Insectivore that eats crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, moths, flies, ants and especially likes insects",
    "Location": "North America, South America",
    "Text": "“ These shorebirds prefer open country habitats with tall grasses, compared to the usual sandpiper coastal environments. ” The upland sandpiper ( Bartramia longicauda) is native to North and South America, where it lives in open country areas with tall grass to hide. It spends its days walking through the vegetation, picking up insects , seeds, and grains. This social bird forms monogamous bonds and lives communally most of the year. Look for their jerky movements on the ground, or flying high in the sky, making their rolling whistles. Discover all the fascinating facts about the upland sandpiper, including where they live, what they eat, and how they behave. Upland sandpipers live across North and South America in over 30 countries, including Canada , the United States, Mexico, Argentina, and Venezuela. They have a relatively wide range, breeding as far north as Alaska and wintering as far south as Argentina. They spend their winters in Northeastern Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil. In the United States, you will mosty find them east of the Rocky Mountains, with some small breeding populations in Oregon and Idaho. These shorebirds prefer open country habitats with tall grasses, compared to the usual sandpiper coastal environments. They have a large population in the northern Midwest of the United States. Males use their feet to clear a space on the ground near dense vegetation, and females make a scrape and line the inside with grasses and leaves. The nest is often hidden by overhanging grass and other plants. The upland sandpiper ( Bartramia longicauda) belongs to the Charadriiformes order in the Scolopacidae family, encompassing sandpipers. It is the only member of the genus Bartramia, which commemorates the American naturalist William Bartram. Its specific name, Longicauda, is Latin for “long” and “tail.” This species is known by several older names, including upland plover and Bartram’s sandpiper. The upland sandpiper is a large sandpiper, measuring 12 inches long and weighing six ounces, with a 26-inch wingspan. This bird is known for its unusual proportions, featuring a rotund body with a long, thin neck and a small head with large eyes. They also have a thin, straight bills, long legs, and long wings. These birds are heavily streaked with chevron-shaped markings on their sides. Their coloring is a marbling golden brown and black, with white below. These sandpipers are social year-round, forming pair bonds and feeding and nesting communally. They also migrate and groups, giving their sad, rolling whistles to each other mid-flight. They fly high and produce fluttering wingbeats. They are long-distance migrants who travel in flocks or family groups at night. They breed in the Northern United States, Alaska, and parts of Canada. And they migrate through Central and Southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, and Northern South America before reaching their wintering grounds in Central and Southern South America (Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina). The upland sandpiper is primarily an insectivore who forages in fields. Their diet consists of crickets, grasshoppers , beetles, moths, flies, ants, centipedes, spiders, snails, and worms. They also supplement their diet with grains and seeds. They forage by walking through grass and picking insects from the ground or vegetation. You can spot them by their jerky movements. The IUCN lists the upland sandpiper as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and very large, increasing population, this species does not qualify for “threatened” status. The biggest threat to this sandpiper is the loss of habitat. They require large expanses of grassland and are vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and total loss. They may also suffer from the future effects of climate change, such as spring heat waves and wildfires. The primary predators of upland sandpipers include birds of prey like hawks and owls and mammalian predators like coyotes. Their nests are especially vulnerable to predation from other birds like gulls and raptors. They conceal their nests in tall grass and weeds and use threatening postures and distraction displays to drive away intruders. Not much is known about their mating system, but researchers believe they form monogamous pair bonds. Their breeding season is early to late summer, and they nest in loose colonies. Females lay four pale pink eggs, and both sexes incubate for 22 to 27 days. The young fledge the nest shortly after hatching and become independent around 30 days when they can fly. These birds live an average of four years but can live up to eight years. The global upland sandpiper population is estimated to number 750,000 mature individuals. This species has been stable since 1970, and short-term trends suggest their numbers are increasing by 13% over the past three generations."

    "Name": "Gray Catbird",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats fruit and insects, such as berries, cherries, grasshoppers, and beetles",
    "Location": "North America, Central America",
    "Text": "“ Listen for their mechanical, raspy mimicry as they hide in bushes and trees. ” The gray catbird ( Dumetella carolinensis) is a medium-sized songbird native to North America. It inhabits dense vegetative areas like overgrown farmland and abandoned orchards, where it prefers to hide in thorny thickets and sing its songs of mimicry. Look for this species low to the ground as it forages for insects and berries. Learn everything there is to know about this catbird, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. The gray catbird lives in North America in over 20 countries, including Canada , the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico , and Jamaica. This species is migratory, breeding in the temperate United States and Canada and wintering in the Southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America , and the Caribbean. They are also extremely rare vagrants to Western Europe . Catbirds inhabit dense vegetative substrates, such as scrublands, woodland edges, overgrown farmland, and abandoned orchards. During the winter, they live in thickets near a water source with plenty of berries. Look for them low to the ground as they hop along thick vegetation, and listen for their mechanical, raspy mimicry as they hide in bushes and trees. They place the nest three to ten feet above the ground in dense shrubs, thickets, and briar tangles. Females build a large bulky cup using twigs, leaves, grass, weeds, and trash and line the inside with finer material. The gray catbird ( Dumetella carolinensis) is from the Mimidae family, which consists of New World catbirds, thrashers, mockingbirds, and tremblers. This family is known for its vocalizations and ability to mimic many species. Its genus, Dumetella, is Latin for “thorny thicket” and refers to the bird’s propensity for singing in hidden undergrowth. Its specific name, Carolinensis, is New Latin for “from the Carolinas.” The gray catbird is monotypic, meaning it has no recognized subspecies. The gray catbird is a medium-sized passerine bird, measuring 8.1 to 9.4 inches long and weighing 0.8 to 2.0 ounces, with an 8.7 to 11.8-inch wingspan. They have long, rounded tails, straight, narrow bills, long legs, and broad wings. They are a lead-gray color all over, but the top of the head, tail, and wing remiges are a darker gray to black. Males and females are indistinguishable, but juveniles are plainer with buffy undertails. Named for its cat-like call, the gray catbird can mimic other birds and animals, like tree frogs . Its voice has a raspy mechanical quality. It has a songbird syrinx and can make two sounds at once. You won’t find them singing their songs while sitting perched on a branch. Instead, they prefer to hide inside bushes as they sing. They spend their days hopping through low vegetation and flying short distances. These birds are rather aggressive and territorial, even during winter. They often run off intruders and will even destroy the eggs and nestlings of other woodland bird species. Gray catbirds breed throughout most of the United States, except for the West Coast. They migrate to the Gulf Coast during winter, from Florida to Texas, down to Central America and the Caribbean. Populations along the US East Coast are nonmigratory and remain in their environments year-round. Gray catbirds are omnivores, and half of their diet consists of fruit and berries. They eat fruit such as holly berries, cherries, blackberries, and elderberries. In the summer, they rely more on insects, like grasshoppers , ants, beetles, worms, and other bugs. It forages for berries in shrubs and trees and looks for insects on the ground by flipping leaves aside. The IUCN lists the gray catbird as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and large, stable population, this species does not meet the “threatened” status thresholds. While this species does not face any imminent threats, it may be susceptible to the future effects of urbanization and climate change. Spring heat waves can endanger the young in their nests, and wildfires can destroy their habitats. Their predators include snakes, rats , cats, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, blue jays, crows, and grackles. These animals mainly prey on catbird eggs and chicks but are not always successful. Gray catbird parents hide their nests in extremely dense shrubbery to prevent nest predation. Their gray plumage also acts as a camouflage as they move in the shadows of tangles. This species is not afraid of predators and flash its wings and tails while making its “mew” sounds. Gray catbirds form monogamous pair bonds during breeding, and courtship involves singing, chasing, posturing, and bowing. Pairs produce two broods per season. Females lay an average of four (but can be anywhere from two to six) greenish-blue eggs. Females incubate alone for 12 to 13 days, but both parents assist in feeding the nestlings. The young fledge the nest 10 to 11 days after hatching. This species becomes sexually mature around one year old and lives an average of 6.3 years. The global gray catbird population is 29 million mature individuals, and their trends have been stable for the last 40 years in North America . They are also not experiencing any extreme fluctuations or fragmentations in their numbers."

    "Location": "North America , South America",
    "Text": "“ Search for these birds in the mid-story of tall trees and look for quick movements as they sally out to catch insects. ” The Acadian flycatcher ( Empidonax virescens) is a small passerine bird native to North and South America, where they inhabit wet riverside forests. They spend their days swiftly maneuvering through trees as they search for insects and small fruit. These solitary birds sing their songs early in the morning and defend their riverside nests with a monogamous partner. Discover all the fascinating Acadian flycatcher facts, including where they live, what they eat, and how they behave. Acadian flycatchers live in North and South America in over 15 countries, including the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and the Bahamas. Their range includes Southwestern Ontario and the Southeastern United States during spring and summer. They migrate through Mexico and Central America before reaching their wintering grounds in Northwestern South America. They breed in wet deciduous forests, such as swamps and dense riverside woods, and live in woodlands in their tropical winter homes. Search for these birds in the mid-story of tall trees and look for quick movements as they sally out to catch insects. They nest in tall trees or large shrubs in horizontal forks away from the trunk. Females form a loose cup made from weed stems, twigs, and grass and lined with plant down. They may use spider webs to hold the material together, but the nest often has a sloppy appearance making it look abandoned. The Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) belongs to the Passeriformes order in the Tyrannidae family, which encompasses the tyrant flycatchers with over 400 species. The Empidonax genus includes small flycatchers, and the name is Ancient Greek for “gnat” and “master.” They were discovered in Acadia (present-day Nova Scotia), but they do not inhabit this area today. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Acadian flycatchers are small passerine birds, measuring 5.5 to 5.9 inches long and weighing 0.4 to 0.5 ounces, with an 8.7 to 9.1-inch wingspan. They have long tails, broad bills, large heads, and long wings. Adults are olive-green above and whitish below, with dark wings and white wingbars. Their bills are dark above and orange-yellow below. These birds are mostly solitary, except during breeding, when they form monogamous pairs and nest near other flycatchers. They typically spend their time perched in the mid-canopy of their forest habitat, sallying out to catch insects and returning to their perch. They sing their songs early in the morning, an emphatic two-note “peet-seet!” The Acadian flycatcher is fun to watch as he quickly maneuvers through trees, using rapid wingbeats to take direct flights. Their exact speed is unknown. Acadian flycatchers are long-distance migrants who begin their spring migration in early March and their fall migration in mid-September. They breed in the southeastern portion of the United States, from South Dakota down to Texas and east through New York and Florida. During migration, they travel along the Gulf Coast down to Mexico and through Central America before reaching their wintering grounds in Northern South America (Colombia and Venezuela). Acadian flycatchers are primarily insectivores who forage by watching from a perch. Their diet consists of wasps , bees, caterpillars, ants, flies, beetles, moths, spiders, and millipedes. They also supplement their diet with some small fruits and berries. They select a perch from the mid-canopy, where they sit and watch before flying out to catch insects mid-air. This flycatcher will also snatch bugs from foliage while they hover. The IUCN lists the Acadian flycatcher as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and extremely large, stable population, this species does not meet the “threatened” status thresholds. Their biggest threats include habitat loss and degradation from forest clearing as a result of agricultural and urban developments. They also face future climate threats, like spring heat waves, which can endanger nestlings. Their predators include crows, hawks, owls, jays, cuckoos, domestic cats, rat snakes, squirrels, chipmunks, and mice. Their young are more likely to fall prey, but parents build their nests in trees hanging over bodies of water because they are easier to defend. Males give rapid alarm calls to warn of intruders and may become aggressive if necessary. Their breeding season falls between April and August, and they form monogamous long-term pair bonds, where they mate with one partner for many years. However, some males have been observed practicing polygamy and will mate with several females. Females lay two to four creamy white eggs and incubate them for 13 to 15 days. Their young fledge the nest when they can fly, around two weeks after hatching. The father feeds the fledglings while the mother begins incubating the second batch of eggs. They reach sexual maturity around one year and live an average of three years, but they can live up to 12. The global Acadian flycatcher population is estimated to number 5.2 million mature individuals. The species declined slowly from the 1970s to 2017, but recent trends suggest their numbers are stabilizing and possibly increasing slightly."

    "Name": "Willow Flycatcher",
    "Diet": "Insectivore that eats insects and spiders and especially likes bees, wasps, ants, flies, beetles, caterpillars",
    "Location": "North America, South America",
    "Text": "Their songs are hoarse and last around one second. It may sound like someone zipping up a coat or a wheezy “fitz-bew.” The willow flycatcher ( Empidonax traillii) is a small and slender, insect-eating passerine. They are native to North and South America , where they inhabit wet meadows filled with willows and other shrubs near water. They spend their days perched in bushes, sallying out to catch insects mid-air or hovering over leaves. This bird sings a tune perfectly unique to its species and even varies based on subspecies. Discover everything there is to know about the willow flycatcher, including where they live, what they eat, and how they behave. Willow flycatchers live in willows or other shrubs near water. But their exact habitat varies by subspecies. Those in the Northwest may utilize drier scrubby areas, while in the Southwest, you can find them in river islands and scrubby fields. They are more lenient with their wintering grounds and can inhabit pastures, woodland edges, and clearings. They are most abundant on their breeding grounds from late May to June, where they are likely to be perched on willows singing their unique tune. Females pick a nesting spot in a deciduous shrub or tree, typically a willow, and place it two to five feet above the earth in a fork of a branch. The female weaves an open cup using grass, bark strips, and plant fiber, and lines the insides with horsehair, grass, plant down, and other soft material. The nest is three inches across and three inches tall, taking around five to ten days to complete during the first breeding season. This species returns to the same nesting site yearly and uses the nest from the previous year to build another. Willow flycatchers ( Empidonax traillii) belong to the Tyrannidae family, which encompasses the tyrant flycatchers, covering 400 species of New World passerines. The Empidonax genus is a group of small, insect-eating flycatchers. The name in Ancient Green means “gnat master.” There are four recognized subspecies of willow flycatcher separated by location: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The willow flycatcher is small and slender, weighing 0.4 to 0.6 ounces and measuring 5.2 to 6 inches long, with a 7.5 to 9.4-inch wingspan. Despite their relatively tiny size, they are actually one of the largest in their genus. They have fairly long wings and a long, thin tail, and they have straight, broad bills for catching insects. Males and females appear very similar in appearance. They are brown olive above and white below with a slight yellow wash. Their wings are darker with white and buff streakings. This species also has a very thin white eyering. These birds live in the understory and are named for their propensity for flitting between willows and shrubs. They perch on the edge of willows and fly out to catch their prey. The flycatcher’s song is the easiest way to identify their species. Male willow flycatchers typically do most of the singing. Although, females can also sing, but are usually quieter. Their songs are hoarse and last around one second. It may sound like someone zipping up a coat or a wheezy “fitz-bew.” Willow flycatchers are long-distance migrants. They breed in Southern Canada and throughout most of the United States , except the Southeast. They migrate through Northern Mexico before reaching their wintering grounds in Southern Mexico, Central America, and Northern South America. Willow flycatchers are mainly insectivorous and use perches to catch their prey. Their diet consists primarily of insects, including bees, wasps , winged ants, damselflies, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, true bugs, and many more. They also eat spiders , seeds, and berries on occasion. Their berry diet includes raspberries, blackberries, currants, and dogwood. This species hunts by perching in low trees and tall shrubs, sallying out to catch insects mid-air. They may also hover over leaves and other foliage to carefully pluck their prey. The IUCN lists the willow flycatcher as LC or “least concern.” Due to its wide range and extremely large population, this species does not meet the qualifications for “threatened” status. These birds are common within their range, but they have undergone a moderate decline since 1970. This species faces threats from habitat loss, habitat degradation, overgrazing, and parasitism from the brown-headed cowbird . Willow flycatchers have several natural predators, including snakes, voles, ravens, hawks, owls, and weasels . King snakes and milk snakes are known for stealing flycatcher eggs, and other species, like great horned owls, long-tailed weasels, and cooper’s hawks , will eat their nestlings. These flycatchers may give chase to intruders, including the brown-headed cowbird, which lays its eggs in flycatcher nests . The courtship behavior of the willow flycatcher is not well-known. However, it likely involves males chasing females and singing. These birds are primarily monogamous, often repairing with the same mate each breeding season. Females lay three to four buff to white eggs with brown spots. And she incubates them alone for 12 to 15 days. Once hatched, both parents bring food and feed the nestlings. Nestlings have their eyes close and are naked with patches of down on their heads and spines. Their young take their first flight between 12 and 14 days old. They undergo their first pre-basic molt before leaving the breeding grounds. The willow flycatcher lives an average of two to three years, but they are known for living up to 11 years. The global willow flycatcher population is estimated to number 8.1 million mature individuals. While their population is not severely fragmented, they are experiencing a continuing decline. This species has been moderately declining at an average rate of 12% over ten years. Due to its vast population size, the decline is not rapid enough to approach a vulnerable status."

    "Diet": "Insectivore that eats bees, wasps, grasshoppers, ants, beetles, cicadas, stinkbugs, and termites and especially likes insects",
    "Location": "North America, Central America",
    "Text": "The western tanager migrates farther north than any other tanager. The western tanager is native to the Americas, wintering in Mexico and Central America before migrating to the Western United States and Canada. They spend their days on the tops of coniferous trees, searching for food and feeding their young. They may be challenging to spot due to their location, but listen closely for their hoarse robin-like songs and bright yellow and orange coloring. Learn everything there is to know about this beautiful bird , including where they live, what they eat, and how they behave. The western tanager lives in and migrates through at least 14 countries, such as Canada, the United States, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica . You can find them in the western United States and northwestern Canada during the warmer months and in central to southern Mexico and Central America during the winter. They breed in open woodlands, primarily in Douglas-fir and Ponderosa-pine trees. You may occasionally find them in aspen forests, wetlands, forest edges, parks , gardens, and burns. During migration, they stop in a wide range of habitats, like urban areas , backyards, parks, forests, and woodlands. During the winder, also inhabit forests and woodlands. To find them, listen for their hoarse songs and chuckling calls. Look to the tops of the trees where they nest and forage; wait for their flashes of yellow and orange. Females build the nests by themselves, while males keep watch. The process takes four to five days, and females diligently scrutinize their potential nesting sites. She chooses a spot in an open canopy area, usually in a fir or pine tree on a horizontal branch away from the trunk. The nest foundation consists of twigs, weaved until they form a cup. And she lines the inside with soft materials like animal hair, feathers, grasses, and plant fiber. The western tanager (Piranga Ludoviciana) belongs to the Cardinalidae family, which includes Piranga tanagers, cardinals, grosbeaks, and buntings. Its genus Piranga is the cardinal bird family, and its specific epithet, Ludoviciana, is Late Latin for “Louisiana.” This species is monotypic, and no other subspecies exist. The western tanager is a medium-sized American songbird, measuring 6.3 to 7.5 inches long and weighing 0.8 to 1.3 ounces, with an 11.5-inch wingspan. They have stocky bodies with thick bills and medium-sized tails. Adult males are bright yellow with black wings and an orangish-red head. They also have white wingbars and black backs and tails. And females are an overall yellowish-green, while immatures have less red on their heads than adult males. Western tanagers are relatively solitary, except for when they form pair bonds. During winter, they may forage with other mixed-species flocks. They spend many days slowly moving along branches and shrubs, looking for food. But the males are vocal, especially during the breeding season. His songs are hoarse, short, and robin-like. These birds are also excellent, swift fliers with powerful wing beats. However, we don’t know their exact speed. Western tanagers are long-distance migrants who move alone or with small groups at night. They migrate farther north than any other tanager. They spend their springs and summers breeding on the west side of the United States ( Colorado , Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, etc.) and as far north as Northwest Canada near Yukon. They migrate through the Central US, parts of the West Coast, and Mexico before reaching their wintering grounds in Southern Mexico and Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica). Some also winter in Southern California . Western tanagers are mainly insectivores who supplement their diet with fruits and berries. They primarily eat insects, such as bees, wasps, grasshoppers , ants, beetles, cicadas, stinkbugs, and termites. During the fall and winter, when insects are no longer abundant, they will eat wild cherries, elderberries, mulberries, blackberries, buds, and seeds. They spend much of their time picking food from branches and foliage in shrubs or at the tops of trees. They will also fly out and grab flying insects like dragonflies and will clip the insect’s wings before swallowing. The IUCN lists the western tanager as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and large, increasing population, this species does not meet the thresholds for “threatened” status. While they are not experiencing any significant ongoing threats, they are still vulnerable to the effects of climate change . Spring heat waves and wildfires could endanger their habitats and young in the future. Hawks, owls , and jays are known predators of adult western tanagers. Their nests are vulnerable to owls, jays, snakes, black bears , crows, ravens, and squirrels. They make loud calls, flap their wings, and swoop toward intruders to defend themselves and their nests. Western tanagers are monogamous breeders who perform courting displays, such as chasing each other. Males defend their nesting territory by constant singing, and the two rarely leave each other’s sides. The breeding season runs from mid-April to mid-August, and females lay 3–5 bluish-green eggs with brown markings. Females incubate for 13 days, while the males bring food. But both parents share the feeding duties of their nestlings. The young leave the nest around two weeks after hatching and undergo a pre-juvenile molt shortly after fledging. These tanagers reach sexual maturity at around one year and can live up to 15 years, but live to an average of 8 years. The global population of the western tanager is unknown, but their numbers appear to be stable. Their species has increased slightly over the last 49 years in North America and doesn’t appear to suffer from extreme fluctuations or fragmentations."

    "Name": "Marans Chicken",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats invertebrates such as insects, larvae, and worms; reptiles; amphibians; small mammals such as mice and enjoys commercial feed treats vegetables fruits",
    "Location": "Europe, North America, Australia",
    "Origin": "The swamps and wetlands near Marans in southwestern France near La Rochelle.",
    "Text": "Marans chickens produce some of the darkest, chocolate-brown eggs in the world! Wandering the vast swamps of southwestern France more than 800 years ago, the indigenous ancestors of the Marans chicken began to breed with imported game fowl from afar. The resulting chickens were further developed over the centuries, incorporating desirable traits from a variety of breeds. By the turn of the 20 th century, a hardy, dual purpose bird approached standardization. The Marans chicken was large, broad at the shoulder, full at the breast, and good for meat. It was a decent layer, too, and produced uniquely deep brown eggs. These eggs would become the breed’s greatest asset, and the trait that makes them among the most popular small flock chickens today. Marans chickens originated in the marshes surrounding the town of Marans, France. The town now lies in the Poitevin Marsh Regional Natural Park, or Parc Naturel Régional du Marais Poitevin . This park lies in southwestern France, near the coastal city of La Rochelle, within one of the largest marsh and wetland regions in Europe. The area is home to a rich diversity of animal and plant life. In the 13 th century, it was home to feral chickens that bred with imported game fowl to begin the evolution of what would become French Marans chickens. Breeders in France organized in the early 20 th century to standardize the breed. The first recorded showing occurred in 1914 in La Rochelle, and by 1931 the breed standard had been established in France. Meanwhile, exporters took the Marans chickens to England in the 1930s. The British Marans chickens known today may have developed independently through selectively crossing several other breeds. They have bare legs and feet, as opposed to the feathered feet of French Marans. Today, Marans chickens of both the French and British types have made their way to several countries in Europe, as well as the United States, Canada, Australia, and perhaps other parts of the world. According to a 2023 piece in the New York Times , Marans chickens are one of the most popular and fastest selling breeds today, largely due to their unique, deep brown eggs. The scientific name of Marans chickens is Gallus gallus domesticus . This name is the same as that of other domestic chicken breeds, which are thought to have evolved from the red junglefowl of southeast Asia. Indeed, even the casual observer can see many similarities between the red junglefowl and the Marans chicken, especially the Black Copper variety. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The common name, Marans chicken, is taken from the town of Marans in southwest France, just a little way from La Rochelle near the coast. The French Marans chickens are thought to have evolved from the native fowl which inhabited the surrounding swamps as they crossed with imported breeds. Marans chickens are medium to large chickens. They are broad at the shoulder and have a strong and upright appearance. Males weigh around 8 pounds, while females weigh approximately 6.5 pounds. Hens reach heights of around 15 inches, while roosters can grow up to about 22 inches tall. They are soft feathered with relatively short tails. They hold their tails aloft at an angle no greater than 45 degrees from their body. Marans chickens have red faces with red earlobes, and wattles. Their large, red, single combs stand up tall and are evenly serrated. They have bright, orange-red eyes. Their beaks are slightly hooked and horn colored, and their legs and feet may be pink or slate. French Marans have somewhat sparse feathers on their shanks and toes. Birds with lightly feathered legs and feet are also the only Marans officially recognized by the American Poultry Association. British Marans chickens, meanwhile, have bare shanks and feet with no feathers. The American Poultry Association only recently recognized Marans chickens, accepting the Black Copper coloring in 2011. They since recognized the Wheaten and White varieties, followed by the Black coloring in 2021. Many other varieties of Marans chickens are recognized by breeding clubs around the world. The Silver Cuckoo Marans, bred in both French and British varieties, are heavily and irregularly barred with black and white. They are among the most popular of the breed in the United States and in other locations. Golden Cuckoo Marans are similarly barred, but with reddish brown and black, while Dark Cuckoo Marans are barred in dark and light gray. The Black Copper variety, also known as Brown-Red, Copper Black, and Birchen, have black plumage with glossy black tail feathers and copper red hackles and saddle feathers. The Silver Black Marans are similar, but with silver in place of the red. White Marans are, unsurprisingly, white. Black Marans are black. Wheaten Marans have feathers that are golden-red to reddish-brown. Other color patterns include Colombian, Black-tailed Buff, Blue Copper, Splash, and more. Marans chickens are described as friendly and relatively docile, but not easily pushed around by other breeds. The roosters are not usually aggressive, but can be quite contentious, possibly due to their evolution from game fowl. They crow, but they are not known to be excessively noisy. The hens are very agreeable and easy to train with treats. These chickens prefer to roost between two to four feet above the ground. They tolerate confinement well, but they do require adequate space in their coops and enclosures as they are larger chickens. They are not the best flyers, but they can fly short distances and reach low branches. Although Marans chickens are known as laid back and even lazy birds, they do love to roam and forage. This is a sturdy breed that does well in most types of weather. Because their feet are not heavily feathered, they can even do well in relatively cold and wet climates. Marans chickens evolved from swamp fowl and game chickens. They are formidable foragers, eating not only invertebrates such as insects, larvae, and worms, but also larger prey such as reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals. These chickens must also be fed a good quality commercial poultry feed with plenty of protein and calcium, especially when hens are laying. Foods such as leafy greens and other vegetables and fruits would be healthy additions to their diets. Even scraps such as bits of meat or pasta and rice make excellent treats as well. Marans chickens lay between 150 and 200 eggs per year. Hens usually begin laying when they are between about 24 and 26 weeks of age, but sometimes take even longer. Marans roosters reach sexual maturity earlier, around 18 weeks. Some Marans breeders suggest keeping a ratio of about one rooster for every six hens. This is more than many other breeds, but the laid back, docile nature of Marans chickens carries over into their mating habits, lowering fertility if a rooster has too many hens. Marans hens tend to go broody and reportedly they are good mothers. The chicks grow rapidly, and they can be much larger than other breeds at the same age. They develop so quickly that some owners express difficulty recognizing young pullets, because they are as large as cockerels. The most desirable trait of Marans chickens is the color of their eggs. They are among the deepest, darkest, chocolate-brown chicken eggs in the world. Only the Penedesenca chickens lay similarly dark brown eggs. Marans hens produce about four eggs per week, averaging between 150 to 200 eggs per year. These eggs are large and round, and they come in deep, chocolate-brown shades that vary based on a number of factors including each hen’s genes. Multiple genes affect not only the depth of color, but also spotting or stippling patterns on the eggs. Color is also affected by how long the egg is held in the hen’s oviduct before it is laid. Marans hens deposit chemical compounds called porphyrins on the outside of their eggshells as they pass through the oviduct. Eggs laid earlier in an egg laying cycle are normally darker than the ones that come later. The longer an egg is held inside the hen, the more pigment is applied. Therefore, a hen that lays fewer eggs per year is likely to produce darker, more desirable eggs. Other factors that affect the color of Marans eggs include the seasonal temperatures and the stress level of the bird. Snakes can easily prey on young chicks in the nest if coops are not fortified well. Hawks and owls can also prey on young chickens, although full grown Marans may be more difficult targets. Because Maran chickens are not the best flyers, and they enjoy roaming freely about, predators such as eagles , foxes , weasels , and raccoons can pose problems. Secure chicken runs and enclosures may be a good solution in areas where predators are a concern. Marans chickens have been around a very long time. They began their journey from wild landrace chickens that roamed freely in the swamps and wetlands of France centuries ago. Today they are growing in popularity due mainly to their unique egg color. Although they are described as rare by some sources, their future looks bright. They are not listed on the Livestock Conservancy’s Conservation Priority List. With continued interest, hopefully they will stay off the list and continue to thrive. Not every egg gets its own place in a legendary story. No one ever even said what sort of egg Humpty Dumpty was, though one might rightly wonder if he was of a thin-shelled variety. The deep brown French Marans eggs, however, will forever be known as a favorite of none other than James Bond. In From Russia with Love , the author, Ian Fleming, wrote that Bond preferred the brown, speckled eggs of Marans hens to ordinary white eggs. Who is to argue with 007?"

    "Name": "Green Tree Frog",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats flies, mosquitoes, crickets, moths and other small insects",
    "Location": "Australia and North America Southeast Asia",
    "Text": "“Three different amphibians are called Green Tree Frog!” Among the more than 800 tree frog species in the world, three share the moniker “green tree frog.” The Australian green tree frog measures approximately 4 inches long, and its back is a bright jade green, while the American green tree frog measures approximately 2.5 inches long, and its back is more olive green. Emerald tree frogs are 2.5 inches long and live in Tawain. All three species are popular terrarium inhabitants. In fact, Australian green tree frogs, first introduced as pets, can now be found in the wild throughout many parts of Florida, which makes these naming conventions all the more confusing. American green tree frogs are the official state amphibian of Louisiana and Georgia. The Australian native’s scientific name is Litoria caerulea . “Litoria” is the name given to the genus of tree frogs native to Australia and nearby locations such as New Guinea , the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands . While species in this genus vary widely in appearance, they all share unpigmented eyelids and horizontal irises. “Caerula” is Latin for “blue” and refers to the fact that this frog owes its striking emerald coloration to blue pigments that overlie a base coat of yellow. The American native’s scientific name is Hyla cinerea . “Hyla” is the name of a genus in the tree frog family “Hylidae” and was inspired by the mythological hero Hylas, a companion of Heracles; “Cinereus,” which is Latin for grey, refers to the olive tinge of this amphibian’s skin. The green tree frog native to Tawain has the scientific name Zhangixalus prasinatus. It belongs to the order Anura and the family Rhacophoridae. it is also called the tributary flying frog and the Tawainese green treefrog. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . There are approximately 800 different species of tree frogs, but only three of them are commonly referred to as ‘green tree frogs.’ We do know something about the evolutionary history of the green tree frog. The species is believed to have evolved from a common ancestor in South America over 10 million years ago. This ancestor was likely a terrestrial animal that adapted to become an arboreal creature, which explains why modern-day green tree frogs are so adept at climbing and jumping from branch to branch. Over time, these animals spread out across Central America and into North America, where they could be found living in trees close to bodies of water. Today, this species inhabits parts of Mexico as well as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Louisiana in the United States. It has also been introduced into New Zealand and Hawaii with varying levels of success. Each species has a chameleon-like ability to change color depending on temperature, lighting conditions, and the animals’ general surroundings. Much of the time, the Australian animal is a bright jade green, while the American animal is a less vivid, greyer green. These colors reflect the hues of the leaves and other vegetation where the animal typically lives. The Australian frog is larger than its American counterpart. Its belly is white; its limbs are short and strong and end in digits that are specialized for sticking to surfaces like trees. During mating season, males grow a black pad on their proximal digit so that they can better grasp the female during amplexus. Beneath its throat, the Australian native has a large vocal sac that’s grey in males and white in females. When fully grown, females are slightly larger than males. The limbs of the American green tree frog end in long, thin digits tipped with sticky spatulate pads. While the Oz native almost appears to grasp the branch upon which it is sticking, the American native merely sticks to it. The green tree frog found in the U.S. also has a white or cream-colored lateral stripe running from its jaw to its groin. Frogs are social animals that live in groups. A group of frogs is called either an army or a chorus. The latter designation reflects the fact that these little amphibians are enthusiastic vocalizers, especially after a rain shower. Their distinctive croaks play an important role in their mating rituals but also serve as a warning when a predator grows too near. Both of these frog species are largely nocturnal. During the day, they like to tunnel into cooler, moister, darker areas from which they emerge as the sun sets, ready to feed and croak. Each of these frog species is a popular terrarium pet. While the Australian green tree frog is a brash little fellow with relatively little fear of humans, its American counterpart is timid and does not tolerate frequent handling. Australian green tree frogs are found in a variety of habitats that range from relatively dry eucalyptus stands in the northwest parts of Australia to the more tropical forests of New Guinea . Though frogs have lungs, much of their oxygen exchange occurs through skin absorption, so their skin must remain moist. Some scientists speculate that the Australian species has a bioregulation mechanism that actually allows it to control the amount of water that evaporates through its skin. Thus, it is able to thrive in seasonally dry and wet habitats. Australian frogs also appear to have some kind of homing ability that allows them to return to the spot they were captured from, even if they were released a fair distance away. American frogs are most frequently found in trees near lakes, marshes, and streams. Their geographic distribution ranges as far north as Delaware, as far south as the Florida Keys, and as far west as Texas. They are especially abundant in the Piedmont and coastal plains of North Carolina. Tawain green tree frogs live in bamboo forests and orchards in northern Tawaiin that are between 1200 to 1,800 feet. These green tree frog species are insectivores, feeding on flies , mosquitoes, crickets, locusts, moths , and other small insects . Frogs only have teeth on their upper jaws, and those teeth are designed not to masticate but to hold prey in place. Frogs’ tongues are very long, often one-third the length of their bodies. Typically, frogs stick their tongues out as bait, and once the prey is attracted, frogs retract their tongues, consuming their prey whole. Australian frogs can grow fat from overeating. Hence, one of the species’ nicknames is “dumpy tree frog.” Since the European settlement of Australia, dogs and cats have joined snakes and birds as frog predators. In general, though, these animals have few natural predators, which is reflected in the length of their lifespan: In captivity, it’s not uncommon for these animals to live more than 15 years. Life is more perilous for the American frogs. Predators include snakes , birds , large fish , and even other species of frogs . These amphibians are among the only frog species that breed in bodies of water that are inhabited by predatory fish. As tadpoles, they can even become prey to aquatic insects such as waterbugs. Their lifespans are shorter than those of their counterparts in Australia; in captivity, they seldom live longer than five years. Habitat destruction through drainage and wetland clearance is causing a decline in the size of these frog’s populations in Australia , particularly throughout the Sydney bioregion. Its American counterpart continues to thrive throughout its geographic range, particularly in locales like Florida and North Carolina. However, amphibians are one of the animal groups on the planet that are at the highest risk of extinction from the activities of humans. Because part of their oxygen exchange takes place through their skin, green tree frogs (and other amphibians) are extremely sensitive to pollution and other environmental changes. Ecologists call species like this “indicator species;” their dwindling numbers may be a sign that planetary conditions are worsening. Snakes and birds eat adult green tree frogs. As tadpoles, these amphibians are eaten by birds, fish , insects , and other frogs . Green tree frogs are insectivores. They feed on a diet of flies , mosquitoes, crickets, and other small insects . These frog species breed from the middle of March to September, most often following a rainstorm. Breeding cycles are influenced by temperature and precipitation in a manner that’s not fully understood, but breeding males tend to vocalize more as the temperature rises and the length of the day increases. Mating takes place in water through amplexus: The male frog grasps the female tightly around the back so that their cloacal openings are in close proximity. Fertilization is external. However, the female expels her through the deposited sperm cloud. American frogs lay approximately 400 eggs, while their Australian counterparts lay 150 to 300 eggs. Australian green tree frog eggs take three days to hatch; American green tree frog eggs take two days longer. The resulting offspring are called tadpoles. For the first few weeks of their lives, tadpoles are water dwellers exclusively, and they look like primitive fish with tails, mouths, and rudimentary gill tracts. Then they begin to go through metamorphosis, which is an extraordinary series of physiological changes that prepare them for life on land. These frog populations in the U.S. typically complete metamorphosis within eight weeks; among the Australian animals, however, metamorphosis durations are much more variable, lasting between four and 12 weeks. Neither of these frog species takes any interest in their offspring once the mating process is over. In the United States , these frogs are found in wetlands across the southeastern part of the country and as far west as central Texas. They are common in Florida and North Carolina. They have even been observed in Hawaii , although these animals most likely are descendants of terrarium escapees. Biologists do not have an estimate for the size of the American green tree frog population, but this animal is not on any endangered species list. Australian green tree frogs are found throughout the northeast regions of the continent as well as in New Guinea . In suburban areas, these frogs are threatened by pollution and predator animals like dogs and cats introduced by European settlers. Outside these areas, their population numbers are stable. As native animals, Australian green tree frogs enjoy protected status under the stipulations of the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 ."

    "Name": "Northern Potoo",
    "Diet": "Insectivore that eats flying insects and birds and enjoys moths beetles",
    "Location": "North America and South America",
    "Text": "It forages rotten branches for beetle larvae. The northern potoo, like other potoo birds , is a strange creature native to the tropical regions in the Americas. These birds are solitary, nocturnal creatures that are hard to spot due to their camouflaging plumage and propensity for tall trees in forests and mangroves. This potoo is mainly unstudied, but they are fascinating creatures with haunting calls. Find out everything there is to know about the northern potoo, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. The northern potoo lives in at least ten countries in the Americas, including Mexico , Guatemala , Honduras, Costa Rica , and Jamaica . They inhabit wet and dry forests and mangroves and lowland woodlands and scrublands. The best place to spot one is at the tops of tall trees, where it sits motionless. You may hear creepy groaning calls at night as it hunts its prey. Occasionally, these birds may frequent trees around golf courses in urban areas. The northern potoo does not construct a nest. Instead, this species uses a natural depression in a branch with no nest material, approximately 13 to 18 feet above the ground. The northern potoo ( Nyctibius jamaicensis ) is from the Nyctibiiformes order and Nyctibiidae family, which includes all potoo birds. Its genus name, Nyctibius, is Ancient Greek for “night-feeding.” Its specific epithet, jamaicensis, is from its locality. The northern potoo has five subspecies, which differ slightly in size and plumage. The northern potoo is a large bird, measuring 14 to 20 inches long, with a long tail, large head, and long wings. We don’t know their exact weight, but they may weigh between 12 and 23 ounces, similar to the great potoo. Their wingspan is between 27 and 32 inches. They have short legs, small bills, and giant gaping mouths. Their plumage is a grayish-brown with black, gray, and cream patterns and markings. They also feature large, round eyes and hoarse, mournful calls that sound eerie as they hunt for prey in complete darkness. Northern potoos are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds, possibly mating for life. Pairs live on the same territory for a long time and are most likely sedentary in their habitat. They roost motionless on their perch in tall trees (typically alone), where they blend with their surroundings. The northern potoo is a nocturnal insectivore who forages for food at dusk and night. They eat large flying insects , and their favorites are moths and beetles . They will occasionally eat small birds. Under cover of darkness, they sit perched on a tree branch, waiting for their prey to fly past. They dart into the air to catch their meal and return to their perch before consuming it, swallowing it whole with their gaping mouths. They also like to search rotten trees for beetle larvae. The IUCN lists the northern potoo as LC or “least concern.” Due to its relatively extensive range and large population, it doesn’t meet the threshold for a “threatened” species. The biggest threat to this species is habitat loss from forest destruction throughout its range. Their exact predators are unknown but may have enemies similar to other potoos. Their possible predators include monkeys , weasels , and falcons . These birds primarily rely on camouflage to defend themselves. Their coloring helps them blend perfectly with their surroundings, becoming virtually undetectable. Northern potoos have a pretty long breeding season from April to July. But in some areas, like Jamaica, they breed year-round. Females only lay one egg (white with dark markings), and both sexes take turns incubating, with males taking their shift during the day and females at night. Both parents feed their nestlings regurgitated insects. Not much research has been done on this species’ reproduction process, including how long they incubate and when the young fledge. The northern potoo has an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years. The northern potoo’s global population is between 50,000 and 500,000 mature individuals. There don’t appear to be any extreme fluctuations or fragmentations, but their numbers are going through an ongoing decrease. This moderate decline is most likely due to habitat destruction."

    "Name": "Lazarus Lizard",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats insects",
    "Location": "North America, northern Italy, Europe.",
    "Text": "The Lazarus lizard, known as the common wall lizard or the European wall lizard, is an invasive species. Locals prefer to call these reptiles Lazarus lizards in Cinncinnati because of their association with the Lazarus family since they are the reason that this lizard now exists in North America at all. Proper identification ensures that you see the difference between the common wall lizard and endemic species. Here are a few interesting facts about the Lazarus lizard. Lazarus lizard, also known as the European wall lizard or the common wall lizard, has the scientific name Podarcis muralis . As the only species of its kind, it belongs to the Lacertidae family of the Reptilia class. The name “ muralis ” comes from the Latin word for “pertaining to walls” or “of a wall,” referencing this lizard’s preference for scaling rocky walls. Though the Lazarus lizard is small, its little legs can carry it quite far. Since its favorite place to spend time is on walls, their colors are typically grey or brown, though there are some green tinges to camouflage them in more lush areas. They have a brown, grey, or dark red tail, which is one of the easiest forms of identification for this reptile. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Along the belly of the lizard, you’ll see six rows of red, pink, or orange scales that are shaped like rectangles. Some of these lizards also feature dark markings along the length of their throat. On average, these lizards only measure about 20cm long, weighing less than half an ounce at their adult size. Lazarus lizards are solitary animals that spend their waking hours in the daytime looking for food, spend time in the sun, and climbing. Though they are quite fast, they tend to be out in the open without seeking a place to hide in urban areas . Since they cannot handle especially cold temperatures, they often look for shelter underground to hibernate in the winter. When they come out in the spring, it is mating season. To communicate to others within their species, the Lazarus lizard uses visual cues and chemical signals, which release from their femoral glands. To defend itself against predators, they don’t usually bite. However, if one manages to bite you, seek out medical attention because there is a risk of salmonella. Originally known as the common wall lizard, the Lazarus lizard comes from Europe. However, they seem to be an invasive species in North America . The only reason that the Lazarus lizard currently has a home in North America is because of a 10-year-old boy named George Rau Jr. Allegedly, in 1951, George – the stepson of Fred Lazarus III – was vacationing in Lake Garda near Milan in northern Italy with his family. Unbeknownst to his family, he snuck between 6 to 10 of the common wall lizards back, getting them through customs unnoticed. Even though there are many people who believe that this claim is nothing more than lore, there are many accounts and research that validate the claim. Though it may seem strange that a European lizard would thrive so well here, Lazarus lizards in Cinncinnati seem to have the same environment available to them as they come across near Milan. They’ve grown exponentially in numbers in the state, leading them to be named the Lazarus lizards after George’s stepfather’s name. Another legend regarding their invasion comes from the Royal BC Museum, explaining that they’ve made their way to Canada as well. Originally, they were housed in a small private zoo, but several of them were released after the zoo’s closure in 1970. Between help from humans and the will to survive, they’ve stuck around and multiplied. No matter where their habitat is located, they inherently find shelter in rocky areas, scrublands, woodlands, orchards, fields, and other settings. They prefer to live in areas with some amount of humidity in the south, though they seek out dry places to live as they go further north. If this lizard species isn’t able to find shelter where they are, they’ll burrow. These lizards are carnivorous, and their diet primarily consists of insects . Lizards in this family sit and wait for food to come by. Typically sitting in the shade or on a wall, they jump out and catch the insect as it goes by them, which is often referred to as an ambush. Even though the lizard is an invasive species, they are hunted by multiple wild birds (including shrike, kestrels, jays, and crows) . Part of the reason that they have so many natural predators is due to the many invasive species welcomed into Ohio , and they’ve established themselves as a part of the food chain. These lizards have an insectivorous diet. The primary prey of the Lazarus lizard includes grasshoppers , crickets , spiders, caterpillars , moths , and butterflies . The lizard primarily breeds in spring, following their awakening from hibernation. The average clutch size of this lizard is 3-10 eggs. The female buries the eggs either under rocks or in the soil to keep them safe until they are ready to hatch, which takes 6-11 weeks. At birth, the babies – also known as hatchlings – are independent from the moment they emerge. They are usually only about 3.8cm as babies, but they have the same colors, patterns, and build as the adults of their species. They don’t need to be nursed by their mother, and their natural hunting instincts keep them alive. They can reproduce by the time they are three years old. The average lifespan of the lizard is about 7-10 years old, though most of them only live to be about 5 years old with the surrounding predators. Due to the fact that this lizard is an invasive species, it is fairly difficult to say how many of these reptiles exist in the world. Their abundant numbers have led the IUCN to classify the reptile as “not extinct.” The only real threats to the species come from it being a non-native species in the United States and Canada , though the population is currently stable."

    "Name": "Mexican Eagle Northern Crested Caracara",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats rabbits, squirrels, skunks, frogs, lizards, snakes, turtles, fish, insects, birds, and alligators",
    "Location": "North America and South America",
    "Text": "The northern crested caracara will sometimes steal food from other birds. The northern crested caracara, also known as the Mexican eagle, is among the most common birds of prey in all of Central America. It is often considered to be its own separate species, but some taxonomists still classify it as a subspecies of the crested caracara. The popular name Mexican eagle is actually a misnomer. This bird is not an eagle at all; it belongs to the falcon family. The closest living relatives include the black caracara, black-throated caracara, and other caracaras. The northern crested caracara is endemic to a huge stretch of territory between the southern United States (mostly Florida , Arizona , and Texas ) and northwestern Brazil , but it is most commonly associated with Mexico and Central America . Its closest related sibling, the southern crested caracara, can also be found from northern Brazil down to the tip of Argentina . These birds prefer to live in semi-open habitats with enough cover for nesting. Nesting sites are usually established at the top of tall shrubs or trees, up to 50 feet above the ground. Live oak, acacias, and even giant cactuses can all become a home for the caracara. The nests are usually constructed out of sticks, weed, and other random debris. They are typically reused from year to year. The scientific name of the northern crested caracara is Caracara cheriway. Caracara is a Spanish and Portuguese word that originally came from the indigenous Tupi language of Brazil. It is probably an imitation of the bird’s call. Cheriway is thought to be the native word for the crested caracara among people from Venezuela . The northern and southern crested caracaras are the only living members of their genus. Together they belong to the falcon family. The main difference between caracaras and other falcons is their more solitary, sedentary lifestyle. They are also slower flyers. The crested caracara is a fairly large bird, measuring up to 26 inches long with a wingspan of around 4 feet. The unique plumage is quite striking: the dark brown lower body and outer wings transitions to a combination of buff white feathers and dark brown bars along the chest. The cheek and neck feathers are mostly buff white with minimal brown. However, the crown at the top of the head, which can be erected into a crest, is covered in solid brown plumage. The beak is an unusual combination of an orange base and light blue tip. The bird also features alternating bands of brown and white tail feathers. Both sexes are similar in appearance, but the juveniles have duller plumage. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The northern crested caracara spends a lot of time flying low in the air, searching for prey on the ground below. They start flying early in the morning and occasionally come down to the ground to hunt. One of their favorite strategies is to follow the winding path of the highway for potential road kills. Crested caracaras are mostly solitary hunters, but they do spend the breeding season with a mate. They communicate with each other through alarm and mating calls. The northern crested caracara is considered to be an obligate carnivore, meaning they must eat meat to survive (although there are some scattered reports that they do consume fruit as well). They are highly aggressive when on the hunt, even chasing away vultures from their kills. It is considered to be an apex predator . The northern crested caracara has a diverse diet that includes rabbits , squirrels , skunks , frogs , lizards , snake , turtles , fish , large insects , other birds and their eggs, and even young alligators . It does not care whether the prey is found dead or alive. It will feed on almost any kind of meat it can find. They will sometimes run along the ground to capture their prey. According to the IUCN Redlist , the crested caracara is a species of least concern . This means population numbers are quite healthy and it requires no special conservation efforts. In some places, however, it does appear to be threatened with habitat loss, road accidents, and low reproductive rates. This bird has disappeared from some parts of its range in the United States. That is why it has a disconnected population in Florida. An adult caracara has few predators in the wild and therefore enjoys a long, healthy lifespan. Eggs and juveniles are more vulnerable to raccoons , crows , and other birds of prey, but they are usually well protected by the parents. The northern crested caracara forms lifelong monogamous pair bonds that mostly last until one partner dies. Courtship usually involves an elaborate ritual in which they toss their heads back and give a guttural call. After pairing up, they will continue to reinforce their bond over the years with mutual preening and care. The breeding season takes place every year between January and March. Together they produce a clutch of two or three eggs, rarely four, at a time. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs for the first 30 days. After the chicks hatch, then parents will continue to bring food back to the nest. It takes about six to eight weeks for the chicks to start flying, but they may remain with the parents for another few weeks. The typical lifespan in the wild is somewhere around 26 years old. It’s difficult to estimate the true population size, but the conservation organization Partners in Flight suggests a combined population for both the northern and southern crested caracara of 2 million. Numbers appear to be increasing overall, but they have declined in parts of the United States. Even though it’s listed as least concern overall, the crested caracara is currently classified on the US endangered species list."

    "Name": "Perch Fish",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats zooplankton, crustaceans, insects, and fish",
    "Location": "Europe, Asian, Australia, North America",
    "Text": "Perch are considered by many anglers to be some of the best freshwater gamefish in the world. Worldwide several hundred species go by the name, but only 3 belong within the perch genus. They belong to the order Perciformes, or ray-finned fish , to which they also lend their name. They are powerful swimmers, and several species are known to put up a fight. All perch belong to the ray-finned fish order Perciformes, which contains 41% of all bony-fish species worldwide. The order takes its name from the Greek word perke, meaning “perch,” and the Latin word forma, meaning “shape.” Hence, all fish in the order of Perciformes are “perch-like.” However, only the 200 species and 11 genera within the family Percidae belong to the category of “true perch.” Additionally, within this family, researchers distinguish the 3 species in the genus Perca as the model of this fish. These 3 species include the European perch or common perch (Perca fluviatilis), the yellow perch or American perch (Perca flavescens), and the Balkhash perch (Perca schrenkii). The European’s scientific name derives from the Latin word fluvius, meaning “river,” while the yellow perch’s scientific name comes from the Latin word flavescens for “yellow-colored” or “becoming gold.” Generally speaking, this fish all tend to look fairly similar, although a few variations in size and color exist. True perch are ray-finned fish with long, round bodies and rough scales. They have paired pectoral and pelvic fins as well as two dorsal fins. The dorsal fins can either grow separately or joined, depending on the species. The first fin is spiny, while the second one is quite soft. European species appear greenish aside from their red pelvic, caudal, and anal fins. These red fins are why some people refer to it as the redfin perch. It also sports eight dark vertical lines on its sides and a large hump between its head and dorsal fin. Meanwhile, the yellow perch appears primarily gold or yellow colored, as its name suggests. Like its European relative, it also sports dark vertical stripes on its sides. Finally, the Balkhash perch closely resembles the European and yellow versions, except that it appears longer and thinner and the dark vertical bars of its relatives. The European measures the largest among the 3 species, with an average weight between 1.5 and 3 pounds and a length of around 10 inches. That said, the longest specimen ever caught measured 24 inches long, while the heaviest weighed 8 pounds, 4 ounces. Next up is the yellow perch, which averages between 4 and 11 inches and around 1 pound. However, some monstrous yellow perch can reach 20 inches long and weigh over 4 pounds. As for the Balkhash perch, the largest specimens reach up to 20 inches and just over 3 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . As juveniles, they usually swim together in schools that can contain anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred fish. However, as they mature, they tend to grow more independent. As a result, the most sought-after typically live alone except when mating. Depending on the species, perch can put up a considerable fight when caught on a line, particularly the larger specimens. They prefer cooler, deeper water, but move to warmer, shallower water to feed or spawn. You can find them all over the world wherever freshwater is located. As its name implies, the European perch is native to Europe as well as parts of northern Asia . However, anglers have also introduced it to parts of Australia , South Africa , and New Zealand . Meanwhile, yellow perch are distributed throughout much of the United States and Canada and are particularly abundant in the Great Lakes. The Balkhash perch lives in a much more confined range compared to its relatives. It is endemic only to the Lake Balkhash and Lake Alakol watershed, which resides predominantly in Kazakhstan . You can find them in various freshwater habitats, including rivers, lakes, streams, and ponds. While most species prefer slower-moving rivers, some will spend time in fast-moving waters. In addition, they tend to avoid especially cold or deep water where the light cannot penetrate. This fish are predominantly found in bodies of water that contain plenty of vegetation and debris where they can find food and hide from predators. Several species prey on them, including other fish such as pike , trout , and bass. Some common predators of perch include birds of prey like ospreys, cormorants, kingfishers , eagles , herons , and pelicans . Other predators include marine mammals such as otters . They are primarily carnivorous, although their dietary habits change as they mature. Therefore, it’s more accurate to classify this fish as omnivores rather than carnivores. Young ones tend to feed mostly on zooplankton and small insects such as mosquitos and midges. By the time they reach adulthood, their diet expands to include small crustaceans such as shrimp and crayfish, as well as other fish. Some fish that they commonly prey on include roaches, minnows, and sticklebacks. Occasionally, perch will also cannibalize their own. Although juveniles are predominantly carnivorous, adults often eat algae and other freshwater vegetation. While not nocturnal, most perch tend to feed around dawn or dusk. They prefer to actively hunt their prey, which is why many anglers use live bait. They rely on their keen eyesight to help them spot their prey. Males sexually mature between 1 and 2 years old, while females sexually mature at around 3 to 4 years old. Perch spawn in the spring and deposit their eggs on aquatic plants. Some evidence also suggests that their eggs can stick to the legs of birds, which may contribute to their transfer to new regions. During a single year, a female can lay anywhere from 2,000 to 200,000 eggs, with larger females laying more eggs than smaller ones. In the wild, most tend to live between 5 and 8 years, while some can live up to 10 or 11 years. Every year, commercial fisheries and sport anglers catch millions of perch. While some species can put up quite a fight, they are still classified as relatively easy to catch with both live and artificial bait. They tend to swim in schools, so where there’s one, you’re likely to find more. Many anglers choose to use live bait and fish at dawn or dusk when perch are most active. In addition to using slip floats, swim baits, and lures and jigs, some fishers also catch them via spearfishing. This fish has delicate, almost translucent flesh. While it possesses a crumbly texture, it holds up well when cooked. It doesn’t smell particularly fishy and, when cooked, tastes mildly sweet. You can prepare it in several ways, including steamed, roasted, braised, or fried. While you can eat it raw, you’ll want to prepare your perch properly if you intend to eat it without cooking it first. Perch are some of the most plentiful freshwater gamefish in the world. They enjoy a relatively long lifespan, reach sexual maturity at a young age, and reproduce prolifically. In addition, their popularity as gamefish ensures that perch are relatively protected from overfishing. Despite the fact that fishers harvest thousands of tons of them every year, most populations are stable. Given this fact, the total perch population likely measures in the hundreds of millions or billions. That said, the Balkhash perch has suffered population declines in recent years, likely due to the introduction of rival predatory fish such as the bream and Volga pikeperch. Still, the IUCN lists all three species of true perch as species of Least Concern ."
