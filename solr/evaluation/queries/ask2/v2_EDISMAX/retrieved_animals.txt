    "Name": "Cat Faced Spider",
    "Diet": "Insectivore that eats insect and smaller spiders and especially likes insects",
    "Origin": "North America",
    "Text": "“ The female cat-faced spider dies shortly after laying her eggs. “ The cat-faced spider is the common name of Araneus gemmoides , a species of orb-weaver spider native to North America. It is a common outdoor spider species typically found near light, in enclosed spaces, and on the side of buildings. Although venomous, the cat-faced spider’s venom is practically harmless to humans because of its low toxicity. The spider is useful in gardens and around the home because it is a natural predator of many insects. Araneus gemmoides is the scientific name of the cat-faced spider. The common name of this spider also applies to the Araneus gemma , a close relative in the same genus but a different species. The name is a reference to the unique shape and patterning of the spider’s abdomen, which looks like a cat’s face. It has two pronounced bumps on its abdomen. These two bumps form the cat’s “ears”, while the pattern at the center of the abdomen resembles the cat’s face. This spider is also called the “jewel spider,” a name they share with another species of spider native to Australia . Cat-faced spiders are orb-weaver spiders (the Araneidae family). Members of this family make circular, hanging, wheel-shaped webs in outdoor spaces like gardens and forests for catching prey. The Araneidae family is the third largest spider family, with about 3,108 species of spiders in 186 genera worldwide. The cat-faced spider is an angulate orb-weaver spider. One of the most distinctive features of this spider is the presence of two prominent horn-like projections on their large, round abdomen. These bumps look like cat ears. The spider also has two dark-colored dimples on the surface of its stomach. The dimples look like cat eyes, giving the spider its unique name. The cat-faced spider typically sits in its orb-shaped web with its head pointing towards the ground. Araneus gemmoides come in a variety of colors, from pale to dark brown. But they also have red, ivory, and white varieties. The color of individual spiders tends to change from winter to summer. Cat-faced spiders lay tiny, round, or disc-shaped eggs. Females carry the eggs in an egg sac containing as many as a hundred fertilized eggs. Female Araneus gemmoides spiders are typically larger than males. Female size ranges between 0.5 and 0.98 inches, while males range between 0.2 and 0.31 inches on average. Cat-faced spiders are outdoor orb-weaver spiders native to North America. They’re found in Canada and the USA. You’ll likely find Araneus gemmoides webs near an outdoor light source or in closed spaces and on the side of buildings. You may also find them hiding under leaves, wood, or in guarded places such as animal burrows. They also tend to stay in their web, waiting for prey or repairing silk damage. Spiders were one of the earliest land animals to have evolved. The ancestors of modern-day spiders emerged out of the water about 400 million years ago (during the Devonian Period). The earliest land-dwelling arachnids looked significantly different from today’s spiders. They were thick-waisted and had segmented bodies. The first spiders with a thin waist and silk-producing organs, similar to modern spiders, lived 380 million years ago. One of the most popular is the Attercopus fimbriunguis . For many years after their emergence, prehistoric spiders were ground-dwelling predators that lived in fern forests. Their diet consisted of other primitive arthropods. Silk production in the earliest spiders was mainly a way to protect their eggs and line their burrows. Later on, the ground-dwelling spiders would evolve to create sheet webs and trapdoors for catching prey. The spiders adapted to using their silk more creatively as plant and insect life diversified. The first major adaptation that made this possible was the development of spinnerets at the end of the abdomen. This adaptation took place more than 250 million years ago. This gave rise to spider families that could weave complex sheets and mazes of webs for capturing prey, such as the orb-weaver spiders, as well as spiders that use their web as a safety dragline. By the Jurassic Period (about 190 to 136 million years ago), the orb-weaver spiders were fully established. They had developed the ability to build aerial webs for trapping the abundant flying insects that lived alongside the dinosaurs. Cat-faced spiders are insectivores; they eat and feed on other insects and arachnids. They can also be cannibalistic, feeding on smaller cat-faced spiders. Cat-faced spiders are mainly insectivores. They build intricate webs for catching flying insects such as flies, butterflies, and moths . They wait for a disturbance in the web to signal that an insect has been caught. Then they attack with a venomous bite to paralyze the insect and feed on it. They can also be cannibalistic. Female spiders lay up to 100 eggs, which hatch during spring. The emerging spiderlings may prey on their weaker siblings if they get the opportunity. Cat-faced spiders also prey on other small spiders. Various large insects and other big spiders may hunt cat-faced spiders for food. Their most prominent insect predator is the black and yellow mud-dauber wasp ( Sceliphron caementarium ). They are also attacked by birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some rodents."

    "Name": "Rock Bass",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats crustaceans, small fish, amphibians, insects, and zooplankton and especially likes smaller",
    "Origin": "North America",
    "Text": "The rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) also known as the black or rock perch , is a type of freshwater fish that belongs to the sunfish family. It’s a medium-sized fish native to the lakes and ponds in North America, popular with anglers for fishing purposes. They are generally smaller than smallmouth bass and have a distinctive appearance, making them distinguishable amongst other popular angler fish. Rock bass belongs to the Centrarchidae family in the Ambloplites genus. The binomial or scientific name for rock bass is Ambloplites rupestris . Rock bass is easy to identify when you know what to look for. These fish have a characteristically large mouth set underneath their eyes, which are a deep red coloration. These fish are not very large compared to other types of bass, only growing around 6-10 inches in length. They can weigh up to 3 pounds, but one pound is common in smaller specimens. Their color is quite interesting, and these fish have predominantly yellowish-brown bodies with silver and black. Shades of black are seen throughout the tips of their anal fins, and black dotted striped line their body horizontally. A black dot is located near the fish’s gill plates. The dorsal fin is spiny and lacks a uniform shape. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Even though rock bass is part of the sunfish family, they do not have a flat body. Their body has a less compressed body that looks similar to a bluegill and largemouth bass. It is not uncommon for this fish to be misidentified as warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), but instead of having three spines on their anal fin, rock bass has around six instead. This fish relies on their body coloration for camouflage purposes, which enables them to change its color to black or silver to match its environment. This can make it difficult to identify them if they are changing their color. This type of camouflage helps to protect them from predators, but it can also change with age and stress. Rock bass is native to east-central North America, but they have been introduced into Atlantic river drainages. They are distributed throughout southeastern Canada from Ontario to Quebec, toward the Mississippi River Basin, and all the way to Missouri and Arkansas. This fish is plentiful in most parts of the Dakota river in the U.S. and the Great Lakes region along with Torch and Champlain lake. They have also entered the Savannah River basin and eastern parts of the U.S., such as New York, Tennessee, and Kentucky. You can also find rock bass in the southern parts of Florida, Alabama, and parts of Georgia in the Chattahoochee River basin. The population of rock bass is considered the “least concern” on the IUCN red list. They are not considered an invasive species. Fishing for rock bass as a sport is managed by some rules and regulations, and artificial water systems are used to manage and maintain populations of rock bass. This is a freshwater fish that inhabit various bodies of water. This includes lakes, river systems, reservoirs, shore banks, ponds, weed beds, streams, and spring holes. These fish prefer cooler waters with plenty of rocks, hence their name “rock bass.” The water should ideally be rich in vegetation and covered with a rocky bottom. The water should ideally have low turbidity, so rocks, wooden branches, and vegetation should be plentiful as hiding places. The bottom of the water system should be filled with rocks or sand. These fish do not typically inhabit waters with silt. Their ideal current is slow-moving, and they avoid river areas with fast-moving currents. The main predators of young rock bass include northern pike, larger bass species, muskies, and walleye. Adult rock bass is generally more protected when they have a larger size. They are carnivorous fish that prey on smaller fish. In some cases, they may eat their own fry if there is insufficient vegetation and rocks to keep the fry safe. The main times that adults can be seen preying on food items are during the early mornings and evenings, and they are diurnal. They will eat a variety of smaller fish, including minnows, amphibians, zooplankton, and yellow merch, along with small crustaceans and insects and their larvae. They will also readily eat a variety of baitfish from the surface. The average lifespan for rock bass is between 8-10 years in the wild. Certain specimens can live longer, but it is uncommon for rock bass to live for more than 12 years. They can reproduce once sexually mature at 2-3 years old. They are polyandrous, which means that they mate with multiple fish during the spawning season. Females can lay more than 5,000 eggs during a single spawn, which occurs around April till the beginning of June in warmer water. Spawning occurs around rock bass nests, typically created close to each other. Males are responsible for building the nest, and they can become quite territorial during this time in efforts to protect the nest. Once spawning has occurred, the male will fan the eggs and protect the fry shortly after hatching. Not all fry enter adulthood, as rock bass sometimes eat their young or are eaten by predators. Rock bass is considered to be game fish, and they are popular for fishing. This fish enjoys a variety of bait such as wax worms, nightcrawlers, minnows, and other types of baitfish. The best way to catch one is to use artificial lures or live bait. A micro fishing rod and a fishing reel with a smooth drag are a good choice for catching them. These fish do not spend much time in the middle of the lake and prefer to school around the bank or shoreline of the water in vegetation and structures where they feel secure. They can be used in cooking, and they are edible. These fish can be pan-fried or baked, but ensuring the internal temperature is right before consumption is important. The flesh of the bass is described as flaky and white."

    "Name": "Kokanee Salmon",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats zooplankton, freshwater shrimp, aquatic insects",
    "Origin": "North America",
    "Text": "The kokanee salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) is a non-anadromous type of sockeye salmon. Alternate names for this fish include kokanee trout, silver trout, Kennerly’s trout, Kennerly’s salmon, little redfish, kikanning, and Walla. Like other Pacific salmon, it only spawns once and then dies, limiting its lifespan to four or five years. It inhabits land-locked freshwater lakes in the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan. The scientific name for kokanee salmon is Oncorhynchus nerka . The name is a mixture of Greek and Russian. Oncorhynchus derives from the Greek terms for “nail” and “snout” while nerka is the Russian word for anadromous sockeye salmon. Kokanee salmon are a type of sockeye that are non-anadromous, or land-locked. Unlike this species, most sockeye are migratory, moving upriver from the ocean to spawn. Kokanee comes from the Sinixt word kekeni , an Indigenous term for the land-locked form of sockeye. The species belongs to the class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) within the superclass Osteichthyes (bony fishes). Scientists further place it in the order Salmoniformes and the family Salmonidae, which contains 11 genera and 66 species of salmon. Sockeye, including kokanee, belong to the genus Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmon and trout) . Prior to spawning, kokanee salmon have steel blue to bluish-green heads and backs, silver sides, and silvery-white bellies. Unlike most other salmon and trout, they do not have dark spots on their backs, though they may have speckles on their dorsal fins. During spawning, males develop a hump and a hooked jaw with teeth (a “kype”). They also turn bright red with dark green heads and black snouts and jaws. Females undergo a similar change, though their colors are duller. The color change is a result of a diet rich in carotenoids, which are pigments responsible for bright red, orange, and yellow coloration in animals and plants. The bright red attracts potential mates, but it also makes these fish more vulnerable to predators. These land-locked fish are typically smaller than anadromous sockeye. This is likely due to a less robust food supply in lakes and rivers as opposed to marine environments. While sockeye can grow up to 33 inches long and weigh as much as 17 pounds, kokanee salmon usually measure no more than 12-15 inches. They can weigh between three to five pounds, though most individuals don’t exceed one pound. However, the largest kokanee on record according to the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) measured 27 inches in length and weighed an impressive 9.67 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This species has fine scales that arrange themselves in rings, which (much like the rings of a tree) can help determine an individual’s age. It also has six types of fins with eight individual fins in total: a dorsal fin, an adipose fin, a caudal fin, an anal fin, two pelvic fins, and two pectoral fins. Kokanee salmon inhabit land-locked areas of the United States, Canada, Russia , and Japan. Within the United States, they occur in a number of states including Alaska , Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Idaho, New York, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, New England, North Carolina, and Utah. In Canada, they inhabit British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon Territory. These fish spend their whole lives in cool lakes, typically swimming at depths of 15-90 feet, though some go deeper than this. At spawning time, they move closer to the shore or upstream into tributaries. The IUCN has not assessed the conservation status of kokanee salmon as of 2022. As of 2010, it lists sockeye salmon as Least Concern due to its stable populations. However, NOAA Fisheries lists sockeye populations in Lake Ozette (Washington) and Snake River (Idaho) as protected under the Endangered Species Act. The WWF warns of potential threats to other Pacific salmon species including climate change, poaching, habitat destruction, river blockages, and overharvesting. You can find a list of endangered species here . The ancient ancestors of kokanee salmon lived as far back as 65-95 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period. During this time, they underwent a significant autotetraploid event in which they developed twice the number of chromosome arms and DNA content. Scientists speculate that this resulted in greater diversity and faster evolution. By the early Miocene Epoch, approximately 15-20 million years ago, two genera within Salmonidae split from each other. The first genus, Salmo , comprises Atlantic salmon ; the other, Oncorhynchus , contains Pacific salmon. Oncorhynchus speciated throughout the Miocene, producing all extant species by six million years ago. Although fossils of Pacific salmon from the ensuing Pleistocene are rare, scientists speculate that northwestern North America’s active geologic history inspired greater diversity among Oncorhynchus than Salmo . It is possible that kokanee salmon came from lake-type sockeye rather than sea-type sockeye. The lake-type may have become land-locked at some point and evolved into its current non-anadromous form. Taxonomists currently debate whether or not kokanee and sockeye salmon belong to two different species. Though they often inhabit the same habitats during spawning season, the two types do not automatically mate with each other. Interestingly, one study in Skaha Lake, British Columbia introduced a sockeye population to a kokanee population and observed the hybrid spawn. It discovered that 92% of hybrid individuals were non-anadromous with 76% being the offspring of resident non-anadromous females. Some sockeye offspring have been known to become non-anadromous while some kokanee offspring have become anadromous. A unique subtype of kokanee, black kokanee , exists in Lake Saiko in Japan and the Anderson and Seton lakes in British Columbia. Some scientists consider the Japanese type to be its own species, Oncorhynchus kawamurae . These isolated populations on either side of the Pacific exhibit black nuptial coloration and spawn much deeper than most sockeye salmon, anywhere between 65-230 feet below the surface. The lack of shared mtDNA haplotypes or a monophyletic grouping suggests that the Japanese populations likely split from the Anderson-Seton populations during two different evolutionary episodes. This may correspond to the multiple proposed postglacial splits of regular kokanee from sockeye. Kokanee salmon are omnivores, though they prefer animal matter to plant matter. Because of their small size, they are restricted to diminutive prey and are themselves easy targets for a number of predators. Kokanee salmon eat zooplankton, aquatic insects, freshwater shrimp, and small plants. Since zooplankton are so tiny, these fish use comb-like gill rakers on their gills to separate miniscule organisms from the water. Chinook salmon are the primary predators of kokanee salmon along with other large fish like rainbow trout, char, sturgeon , and burbot. They are also the targets of bears, wolves, otters, osprey and bald eagles , not to mention humans. The risk increases dramatically during spawning season when both males and females turn a conspicuous red. Unlike sockeye, kokanee salmon do not migrate from the rivers of their birth to the ocean. Instead, they move to nearby lakes, where they spend four to five years growing and maturing. After this, they reach sexual maturity and are ready to spawn either in the lake shallows or upstream in tributaries. Like all Pacific salmon, they are semelparous, dying soon after spawning. Because of their mating habits, these fish live only four to five years. Typically in their fourth year, males and females make their way to the site of their birth during a period of time called a “run.” Runs occur between August and December depending on the location. The female digs a trench, or a “redd.” Other, subordinate males may be in attendance, though the dominant male will fight them off using his kype and hump. The female may also be aggressive toward them as well as other females. Once ready, the female and dominant male descend together into the redd. They gape and vibrate until they release eggs and milt (sperm). One female typically lays approximately 1,000 eggs, though she may lay more or less depending on the availability of food sources. The other males may also release their milt on her other side. The female covers the fertilized eggs as she digs a new redd just upstream in preparation to spawn again. Both males and females may mate with multiple partners. The eggs incubate for approximately 110 days, usually hatching in February or March. Newly-hatched alevins depend on attached egg-yolk sacs for nutrition for the first two to three weeks of life. Once they develop into fry and then juveniles, they move downstream to a nearby lake or into deeper waters to feed and grow. Kokanee salmon are popular recreational or sport fish, though other sockeye salmon are important to commercial fisheries. NOAA estimates the 2021 worldwide commercial catch for sockeye salmon at 272 million pounds with a total value of $459 million. The vast majority of sockeye comes from Alaska, though fisheries net smaller numbers off the West Coast, mainly around Washington and Oregon. Though they are great for canning, these fish are also good fresh or frozen. For this species, fisheries typically use gillnet purse seines or reef nets. Though kokanee salmon are small, they are aggressive and fight hard to free themselves, making them valuable to recreational and sport anglers. These fish travel in schools, making it possible to catch multiple fish in one session. They are active during the day but are likeliest to bite at dawn and dusk when the light is low. The best types of bait are pink maggots, dye-cured shrimp, or canned corn, though anglers should be careful not to overload their hooks. One or two pieces of bait per hook should be sufficient. Kokanee salmon flesh is soft, rich, and vibrantly red with a pleasant, relatively mild taste. Acceptable ways to cook kokanee salmon include grilling, roasting, frying, smoking, and baking. Check out this comprehensive guide to smoked kokanee or explore a number of methods for preparing this delectable fish. This recipe for herbed kokanee with roasted garlic and lemon butter is a great way to get started. This fish yields relatively lean meat much like that of sockeye flesh . Per 155 grams, it contains 261 calories, 39 grams of protein, and 10 grams of fat."

    "Name": "Towhee",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats snakes , lizards, insects , worms, snails",
    "Origin": "North America",
    "Text": "Towhees are a group of songbirds containing nine different species. They belong to the family Passerellidae, also referred to as the New World sparrows. Many people struggle pronouncing their name, but it is quite simple, Tow-Hee. Their most distinctive feature is their red eyes. All species of this family reside in North America. The biggest species is the Eastern towhee ( Pipilo erythrophthalmus ) There are nine species of Towhees, but the most popular are: Collared towhees have bright patterns and inhabit the highlands of south-central Mexico. They are generally found in flower banks, overgrown fields, pine forests, and brushy understories. They are often seen feeding along the edges of fields and on quiet roadsides in the late spring. These birds are typically quiet, but do sing from low trees or bushes. They have rusty caps, brightly striped heads, and bold white throats, which contrasts with the wide black collar around their necks. Although they are mostly quiet, their songs and calls are quite loud; unlike a similar species, the chestnut-capped brush finch. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The spotted towhee is a large, striking bird that inhabits sun-filled thickets in western regions of North America. Males have black backs with white spotting and stripes, while females are a grayish-brown color. Their rufous flanks are a rusty color to match the dry leaves they spend most of their days in, making them hard to see when in leaf litter. So, the best time to view these birds is in the spring when they sing from the top of bushes and shrubs. Eastern towhees are the largest of the genus, and they inhabit the eastern regions of North America, as their name suggests. They are black and reddish-brown in color, with striking white marks covering their bodies. These birds prefer to rummage through the undergrowth and make a considerable racquet when doing so. In addition, they have chewink calls that are surprisingly loud for their body size. Canyon towhee is considered a large sparrow because they belong to the family of New World sparrows. They have brown plumage and look a lot like their cousins, the California towhee; however, they do not share the same habitat. These birds are ground-dwelling and found in various habitats like desert grasslands, brushy areas, and suburban gardens. Their diet consists of seeds and several types of invertebrates. These birds inhabit various ecosystems like woodlands, forests, and urban cities. They can live as high as 6,500 ft, although they prefer lower altitudes because of the warmth. All species live in North America and build their nests in bushes or on the ground under shrubs. However, they spend most of their days on the ground, rummaging through the foliage for food, and really thrive in areas with thick undergrowth. In addition, they occupy low-hanging branches where they feed on fruits and insects. Although there are several species of these birds, their habitat range is vast and diverse. For example, the eastern towhee (the most common) prefers the edges of fields, woodlands, and forests. Because there is more than one specie, their nests differ. For example, the spotted towhees build their nests on the ground or just above it in shrubs. However, females generally build the nests, which takes around 5 days to complete. The size and appearance of these birds vary between species. The spotted towhee has a black back and throat. The males have white spots on their wings and a white belly. Females are similar except for their grayish-brown plumage. Eastern towhees are the largest species of the genus and have a wingspan of 9 to 10 inches. Their sides are rusty, and they have dark tails with white bellies. Males have black backs, but females have brown plumage. Eastern towhees measure between 6 to 9 inches long. However, the Albert towhees are 8.3 to 9.8 inches in length, with a wingspan of 10.4 to 11.6 inches. Smaller species like the green-tailed towhee only measure 7.5 inches long, and the spotted towhee is similar in size to a Robin . The eastern towhee can weigh anywhere from 0.1 to 1.1 pounds. However, the average weight of towhees is around 0.9 pounds. Most species in this genus are non-migratory. However, some are partial migrators depending on their location. For example, the northern populations of eastern towhees do migrate, while the southern populations stay put all year round. In addition, another species that does not migrate is the California towhee. These birds are generally solitary; they even have signs for when they want to be left alone. For example, males will flick their tails and droop their wings to let others know they are not welcome. Males are also fiercely territorial and defend their homes way more than is needed. Eastern towhees’ mating season spans from spring to summer; however, this can change depending on their location. Females take 5 days to build a nest and lay about 2 to 5 eggs. The eggs incubate for around 12 to 13 days. Once their eggs hatch, both parents will feed the offspring for about 30 days. However, spotted towhee parents only stay for 10 to 12 days. Spotted towhees build their nests on the ground or just above it in shrubs. Females produce at least two broods per season and lay around 3 to 5 eggs. Their eggs are creamy white or grayish in color and appear elongated. Lifespans differ between species, but the eastern towhee can live as long as 12 years, while spotted towhees can live up to 11 years. On average most towhee species live around 10 years. These birds are omnivores, typically eating fruit, plants, and animals. Their diets generally consist of: The towhee has many predators, which include: While there is no official conservation status for the entire genus, many towhee species are listed as Least Concern on IUCN’s Redlist. However, there are some species that are in danger, like the sirocco towhee ( Pipilo socorroensis ), which is listed as Endangered . These birds have a declining population due to invasive species out-competing them, weak genetics, and disease. There is no official record for the towhees population size. However, most species are stable."

    "Name": "Blue Death Feigning Beetle",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that enjoys vegetables, fruits, lichen, shrimp, dead insects",
    "Origin": "North America",
    "Text": "When threatened, blue death feigning beetles will pretend like they’re dead. Blue death feigning beetles are a species of darkling beetles native to the United States Southwest. They are known for their remarkable ability to play dead when they feel threatened by predators, which is why they’re called death-feigning beetles . These beetles are also known to be highly resistant to heat. Their entire body, including their legs, is a steely blue color. Death feigning beetles are omnivorous, feeding on both plant and animal matter . Due to their unique properties, these beetles are common as pets these days. Asbolus verrucosus is commonly known as blue death feigning beetle or desert ironclad beetle. This is a species of beetle native to the United States Southwest. It is most notably found in the Sonoran desert , but its range extends to other parts of North America , especially Mexico. Blue death feigning beetles belong to the family Tenebrionidae. This is a large family of cosmopolitan beetles, commonly called darkling beetles . There are more than 20,000 species of beetles in this family. Many of the species of darkling beetles are adapted to live in arid environments, and that includes Asbolus verrucosus as well. In fact, Asbolus verrucosus beetles are known for their ability to survive in extremely hot environments. Their common name (blue death feigning beetle) references their steely blue color. Their entire body, including their appendages, is completely blue. Another common name for this insect is desert ironclad beetle which refers to their ability to survive in hot desert environments. Their specific name, “verrucosus,” means ‘warty,’ and is a reference to the characteristic bumps on their elytra. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The blue death feigning beetles are a powdery blue color. Their color is a result of a coating of wax on their exoskeleton. The wax coating is an adaptation that helps to protect the insect against moisture loss. In high-humidity environments, their blue color will turn a darker shade. Desert ironclad beetles are small bugs measuring about 18-21mm (0.71–0.83 in) from head to abdomen. They are characterized by the presence of “warty bumps” on their elytra. Males are typically smaller than females. They also have bristly red hairs on their antenna. Most darkling beetles can release defensive toxic fluids to ward off predators. But Asbolus verrucosus lacks such defenses. The defense strategy of this bug is to play dead when threatened. Since they don’t have wings to fly away from predators, they simply roll over and tick their legs up like they are dead. Many predators that feed on insects, such as spiders , prefer only live prey and would most likely leave the death feigning bug alone. Another impressive adaptation of this insect is its high thermal tolerance. Their warty, fused elytra helps to protect the insect against dedication. The blue death feigning beetle is native to the deserts of the Southwestern United States. It is most commonly found in the Sonoran desert. However, the range of this insect extends into surrounding states as well as Mexico and Canada . This beetle is also known as the desert ironclad beetle because of its ability to survive in harsh desert environments. Their exoskeleton has an ashy-blue wax layer, an adaptation to survive heat and water loss in their arid surroundings. They can increase the amount of wax secreted based on the humidity in their environment. When the humidity is low, the beetle turns a lighter shade of blue due to more wax secretion. They’re completely black when the humidity is high. Because they’re so easy to care for, many people keep this beetle as pets. They do well in captivity, as they have a varied diet and can survive under different humidity conditions. Like most darkling beetles, desert ironclad beetles are omnivorous with a very diverse diet. They feed on both plant and animal matter. In captivity, people have successfully kept them on dog and cat foods, vegetables, fruits, shrimps , lichen, and even dead insects. They are crepuscular, meaning their most active times of the day are at dawn and dusk. Spiders , birds , rodents , and lizards prey on insects like blue death feigning beetles. However, this beetle has developed an adaptation that helps it to escape being eaten by prey. It plays dead when threatened, turning on its back and keeping its body extremely rigid. The insect will remain like this for as long as it takes to evade predators. Unless caught by surprise, this adaptation helps them survive predators in their natural habitat."

    "Name": "Spotted Bass",
    "Diet": "Eats small crustaceans, insects, zooplankton, crayfish, smaller fish, larger crustaceans, frogs, worms, aquatic arthropods that enjoys crayfish and especially likes ",
    "Origin": "North America",
    "Text": "The spotted bass is a black bass endemic to North America , particularly the eastern part of the United States . These beautifully spotted fish are incredibly popular, not only for recreational sport but also as part of the local cuisine. They are often mistaken for their largemouth and smallmouth bass counterparts because of the beauty of their skin patterns. Due to their popularity as game fish, they have also been introduced to other countries. The spotted bass is a North American fish known in the science world as Micropterus punctulatus . Its generic name Micropterus means “small fin” while its specific name punctulatus means “spotted.” Its characteristic feature is its spotted skin, hence its name. This fish is usually referred to as “spotty” or “spots” by locals. It is also sometimes known as the Kentucky bass or the spotted black bass. Spotted bass belongs to the family Centrarchidae , also called sunfishes, and order Perciformes . Three subspecies of spotted bass have been recognized throughout the United States, such as Alabama spotted bass, northern spotted bass, and Wichita spotted bass. Spotted bass are medium-sized fish. They have laterally compressed bodies and can be identified by their pale green to light golden-brown markings which cover their backs. They also have black spots, mottled pale sides and underbellies, and dark streaks of scales running along their sides. Spotted bass also have deep red eyes. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Spotted bass grow very slowly and don’t get extremely large like other bass species. They usually grow to be about 25 inches in length and less than 11 pounds in weight. The largest spotted bass ever recorded was 10.27 pounds and was caught in California . Spotted bass are often mistaken for largemouth bass due to their similarities in appearance. They share similar mottled markings and colors with the largemouth bass. However, they can be differentiated by the size of their mouths. Spotted bass have significantly smaller mouths than largemouth bass. Also, the dark streaks of scales that run along the sides of the spotted bass are less uniform than those of largemouth bass. The cheek scales on the spotted bass are much smaller than the scales on the rest of its body, whereas the scales on a largemouth bass are all uniform in size. Another fish the spotted bass is sometimes mistaken for is the smallmouth bass . One way to tell these two species apart is that the smallmouth bass has vertical stripes that the spotted bass doesn’t. Spotted bass are freshwater fish and prefer to inhabit moving water, such as rivers, reservoirs, and streams. They like water sources with gravelly and rocky beds. They live in warm waters that have enough aquatic vegetation and debris. You will hardly ever find these spotted beauties in a lake and never in brackish water. They like to inhabit areas with enough aquatic vegetation to enable them to hide from predators. They are also non-migrating fish. Spotted bass are prolific and have spread throughout the United States despite originating in the eastern part of the country. They have a wide range and are endemic to the Mississippi River basin. They can be found from Texas to Florida , as well as in North Carolina , Georgia , Kentucky, and Virginia where they have been introduced. They are predominantly found around the Choctawhatchee River, as well as other moving water sources in Florida. This fish was also introduced to southern Africa where it was considered an invasive species. After successful efforts, it was duly exterminated in 2014. The spotted bass is a part of the freshwater ray-finned fish family, Centrarchidae , whose earliest fossils date back to the late Eocene (38 million to 33.9 million years ago) and early Oligocene (33.9 million to 23 million years ago) periods. These fossils belong to now-extinct genera of centrarchid fish, Plioplarchus and Boreocentrarchus , and were found in Montana and South Dakota in Miocene deposits that date back 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago. These early fossils, unlike the spotted bass, had more than three anal fin spines. Members of the sunfish family typically share characteristic features such as having laterally compressed bodies, thoracic pelvic fins, three to eight anal fins, two dorsal fins, and six to 13 dorsal spines. Species in the genera Micropterus as well as Lepomis all have three anal fins. This unique physical feature is used to identify them and distinguish them from other members of the family. Centrarchidae fish prefer warm water, therefore their native range is usually cut off by colder water and temperatures around southern Canada . Centrarchidae contains eight genera and 38 species with only 34 of these species living today. Spotted bass are not large fish, so they typically have a lot of predators including snakes , alligators , and turtles . Humans can also be considered one of their predators. Spotted bass do not face any immediate threats. However, climate change is a potential problem. These fish are predators and like to live in warm waters. Their range is bounded by cold northern temperatures. With waters becoming warmer, their range could possibly expand northward and put other aquatic species at risk of their invasion. Spotted bass have already become invasive species in the countries where they were introduced, such as southern Africa, Mexico , Italy , and Japan . Their presence in these locations has severely affected the native fish populations. The spotted bass’s carnivorous diet depends on its lifecycle stage. As juvenile fish , they consume small crustaceans , insects, and zooplankton . When they mature into adults, their diet consists primarily of crayfish , smaller fish, larger crustaceans, frogs , worms , and aquatic arthropods. Spotted bass are known to have a less voracious appetite than largemouth bass. Their hunting method involves opening their mouth in the presence of their prey and allowing the force of the pressure to sweep the prey into it. Spotted bass usually reach sexual maturity at the age of one, but oftentimes, they do not engage in reproduction until much later when they are around four years old. The breeding season for the spotted bass typically takes place in the spring around April or May or when the temperature hits 63 degrees Fahrenheit. This can occur much earlier in the year provided the temperature is adequate. The female spotted bass is enticed by the male to lay her eggs in a bed of gravel cleared by him, after which she is chased away. Female spotted bass can lay anything from 1,150 eggs to about 47,000 eggs. The male spotted bass then looks after the eggs, guarding them even after they hatch into fry, and a few weeks afterward. Spotted bass have an average lifespan of six years old. Spotted bass are recreational and commercial fish. This means that they are successful sport fish, and are also caught to be eaten. They are frequently caught by accident by fishermen looking to catch largemouth or smallmouth bass instead. If you are fishing for spotted bass, you would do well to have a powerful grip! Spotted bass are very aggressive fish when fighting to avoid being caught. When they are on the hook, they tend to swim downwards into the water rather than jump around. They are notorious for their fighting skills and resistance to being captured. This trait makes them interesting sport fish because they add to the challenge and give you a run for your money. In order to increase your chances of catching a spotty, you should move to rocky banks and bluff ends. Spotted bass like to inhabit these types of places. The best times for fishing for spotted bass are in the early summer with prop baits or walking plugs, or in the late summer with worm bait. Spotted bass meat is firm, white, and doesn’t have an extremely fishy taste. It is usually prepared pan-fried or pan-seared. The conservation status of the spotted bass is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . Its population is considered to be stable."

    "Name": "Rufous Hummingbird",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats some insects and enjoys red flowers",
    "Text": "This hummingbird has brilliant coloring and can travel from Alaska to Mexico in one migration. As one of nine species of hummingbirds in its genus, the Rufous hummingbird is named for the reddish-orange coloring that most males have on their heads and chests. They favor red-colored flowers but also eat insects. Learn more about these fascinating birds . The Rufous hummingbird is native to North America , from Alaska to Mexico. They breed in Alaska and the Western parts of Canada and the United States during the spring and summer. They take advantage of native wildflowers in these regions as a reliable source of food. For the winter, they travel almost 4,000 miles to migrate to parts of Mexico. They need a warm climate to survive and cannot overwinter in the northern parts of the continent. This little hummingbird is known by the scientific name Selasphorus rufus . It is one species within the Selasphorus genus. There are nine species within the genus, which was established in 1832. The Rufous hummingbird is the type species. Previously, it was placed in the Trochilus genus along with other hummingbirds when it was discovered and described in 1788. The Rufous hummingbird is part of the Trochilidae family. It includes all hummingbirds, around 360 species in total. Hummingbirds are recognized by their ability to hover and feed on nectar, although they also eat insects . They were given the name hummingbird due to the humming sound that their fast-beating wings make when they hover. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Hummingbirds belong to the Apodiformes order of birds, which also includes Swifts and Treeswifts. It is one of the most diverse orders of birds and has more than 450 species. They are part of the Aves class, which includes all birds. Birds are characterized by the presence of feathers, toothless beaks, a heart with four chambers, a high metabolism, and a lightweight skeleton. All birds also lay eggs to reproduce. Hummingbirds are part of the Chordata phylum and Animalia kingdom. While the Rufous hummingbirds are native to North America, they are part of a larger species of hummingbirds that began in Europe around 42 million years ago, when they began to diverge from their closest living relatives, the swift. The oldest known fossil is from southeast Germany, around 30 million to 35 million years ago. However, this species became extinct in Europe, it is still unknown how or why, and eventually migrated to North America and South America. The hummingbird of today evolved in the Americas about 22 million years ago. The Rufous hummingbird is in a genus that includes eight other species. This genus, Selasphorus , has the following hummingbirds: These tiny hummingbirds are around three inches long. They are not the smallest of all hummingbirds but do represent a good example of these interesting animals. The males are brightly colored, with a reddish-orange face. This gave them their name, Rufous, based on this coloring. They have white breasts and an iridescent orange patch on their throat. In fact, the Audubon Society Guide to North American Birds describes it as “glowing like a copper penny.” This helps bird watchers spot Rufous Hummingbirds easier, although this coloring is unique to the males. Some males also have green coloring on their backs or at the crown of their heads. Females more often have green coloring and are slightly larger than the males. They look similar to the Allen’s hummingbird, which also lives in many of the same places. Like other species of hummingbirds, the Rufous hummingbird eats nectar from flowers. It uses a long proboscis and tongue to access the nectar buried deep in the flower’s structure. It also eats insects that it catches on its wings. They tend to feed on red flowers , including penstemons, red columbines, paintbrush, scarlet sage, and gilia. When feeding, the Rufous hummingbird hovers in mid-air using its wings. They use downstrokes to generate lift at a greater rate than upstrokes. When feeding on sugar substances at hummingbird feeders, they do perch when given the chance. This helps them conserve energy, although they do not perch for long periods of time. Because they are small, Rufous hummingbirds can be prey for other larger birds and animals. Snakes in particular are quick to make a meal out of an unsuspecting Rufous hummingbird. Other threats include changes to their habitat and food sources. Pesticides can impact the availability of insects that make up a critical part of their diet. They are not picky when it comes to the type of insects that they eat, although there does need to be a ready supply. Early blooming of their flower food source can also make it hard for them to get enough to eat. They migrate and if the flowers have already bloomed by the time they get to their destination, Rufous Hummingbirds are not able to get the nectar inside. Like all other birds, the Rufous hummingbird lays eggs . The females build nests in trees and shrubs that are protected and hidden from predators. She uses moss to help the nest blend in better. They can also use old nests and refurbish them with additional grass, moss, and plant matter to make it sturdy and soft. The males will mate with more than one female, who then looks after the eggs until they hatch. This typically takes around two weeks. The females feed the young hummingbirds, who eventually leave the nest and fly around three weeks old. They typically stay around the Pacific Northwest when breeding, including Oregon , Washington , and Canada. They can travel as far north as Alaska, although they are less common in this area. Scientists are watching the Rufous Hummingbird population, which has been declining in recent years. While not listed as endangered, the International Union for Conservation of Nature did upgrade it to Near Threatened in 2018 based on population numbers and observations. The Nature Conservancy Canada estimates that its numbers have declined by as much as 60% since data was collected in the mid-1960s. The change in climate and temperature are thought to be the biggest threats to this hummingbird. As migratory birds , they rely on the seasons to dictate not only their nesting habits but also make their food sources available. If these change, it can have long-term effects on the Rufous Hummingbird population. Allen’s Hummingbird : This hummingbird, known by its scientific name Selasphorus sasin , is closely related to the Rufous Hummingbird and has similar coloring. It tends to stay near California , however, and has a more limited geographic range. Ruby-throated Hummingbird : The Archilochus colubris has a brighter patch of ruby-colored feathers at its throat, which makes it easy to spot. It lives in similar climates to the Rufous Hummingbird but also goes to the Eastern United States to breed."

    "Name": "Orchard Oriole",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, spiders, pollen, nectar, berries, and flowers",
    "Text": "“ They are easy-going birds who show little aggression toward other bird species. ” The orchard oriole ( Icterus spurius) is a small passerine bird native to North and South America, inhabiting orchards and woodland edges. These social birds are easy-going and show little aggression, often joining mixed-species groups. Listen for the male’s rapid musical songs during spring when he courts his mate. Discover all the interesting facts about this oriole, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. Orchard orioles live in North and South America in 14 countries, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Bolivia. They spend their springs and summers in the eastern half of the United States and central Mexico, migrating mid-summer to their wintering grounds in Central America and the northern tip of South America (Colombia, Venezuela). Their breeding habitats include semi-open areas, such as orchards and wood edges; they winter in the lowland tropic’s brushy areas. They may also inhabit suburbs, prairie groves, and riverside trees. They nest in deciduous trees or tall shrubs in the fork of a horizontal branch, sometimes around clumps of Spanish moss. Females build hanging baskets made from grass and plant fiber and lined with fine grass and plant down. The orchard oriole ( Icterus spurius) belongs to the Passeriformes order in the Icteridae family, which encompasses the New World blackbirds. The Icterus genus includes the New World orioles and is sometimes mistaken for New World warblers. There are three recognized subspecies of orchard oriole. The orchard oriole is a small passerine bird, measuring 5.9 to 7.1 inches and weighing 0.6 to 1.0 ounces, with a 9.8-inch wingspan. They have sharply pointed bills, medium-length tails, and round heads. Adult males have chestnut underparts and rumps, and the remaining plumage is black. They also have black bills and white wingbars. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . This species is relatively social, forming pairs during the breeding season and foraging and roosting in groups during the winter. They are easy-going birds who show little aggression toward other bird species. Males are most vocal during the spring, and their songs are rapid, musical warbles similar to a purple finch. They are light, agile fliers that produce rapid wingbeats and may hover over foliage to search for food. Orchard orioles are long-distance migrants, arriving on their breeding grounds in late May and leaving by mid-July. They breed in the eastern half of the United States and central Mexico, migrating through northern Mexico and northern Central America before reaching their wintering grounds in Central America and the northern tip of South America. The orchard oriole is an omnivore who primarily eats insects but supplements with fruit and plant material. Their diet consists of beetles , grasshoppers, caterpillars, spiders , wasps, ants, nectar, pollen, berries, and parts of flowers. They mainly eat insects during the summer but supplement with berries, nectar, and other plant material during the winter. They forage among the foliage of trees and bushes, probing flower blossoms and snatching insects. This species feeds in flocks during winter. The IUCN lists the orchard oriole as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and very large, stable population, this species does not meet “threatened” status thresholds. However, these birds still face threats in certain parts of their range, such as habitat loss, cowbird parasitism, and overgrazing which destroys shrub vegetation. Their predators include crows, owls , squirrels, foxes, and domestic cats. These predators typically target their eggs and young, but parents will defend their nests. Orioles use alarm calls to warn of potential danger and will mob intruders who get too close. Orchard orioles form monogamous pairs during the spring but will change partners each year. This species is not very territorial, and more than one pair may nest in the same tree. Females lay an average of four to five pale bluish-white eggs with brown and gray spots. She incubates them for 12 to 15 days while males bring food. Both parents feed the nestlings, and the young fledge the nest 11 to 14 days after hatching, but they remain with one or both parents for several more weeks. They become sexually mature and acquire their adult plumage around two years and live an average of five years. The global orchard oriole population is unknown, but they have had stable numbers in North America for the last 40 years. They are not experiencing any extreme fluctuations or fragmentations in their population."

    "Name": "Fox Squirrel",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, bird eggs",
    "Text": "“Fox squirrels use scents to communicate with other squirrels, although it is not territorial.” The fox squirrel, also called Bryant’s fox, eastern fox, stump-eared, raccoon, and monkey-faced squirrel is a common tree squirrel species. It is native to North America . The largest North American squirrel species that exists, is twice as large as the grey squirrel, which is more common. People may confuse it with the eastern grey squirrel or the American red squirrel . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The scientific name of the fox squirrel is Sciurus niger , which means “black squirrel.” Squirrels are rodents and so they are in the order Rodentia. Their family is Sciuridae, which includes small and medium-sized rodents. Ground squirrels, tree squirrels, flying squirrels , chipmunks , and prairie dogs are all members of Sciuridae. The fox squirrel genus, Sciurus, includes many of the common, bushy-tailed squirrel species around the world. Identification of fox squirrels includes 10 subspecies, which differ by size and geographic location: The eastern fox squirrel, also called the fox squirrel, has a subspecies known as the Delmarva fox squirrel (Sciurus niger cinereus), which was previously found in the Delmarva Peninsula, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey, but currently inhabits only the eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia. Fox squirrels have a natural range that extends through most of the eastern United States, north into the southern prairie provinces of Canada, and west to the Dakotas, Colorado, and Texas, but they are absent in certain areas, such as New England, New Jersey, most of New York, northern and eastern Pennsylvania, Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Although they have been introduced to various locations, including several Canadian provinces and several western U.S. states, they are most commonly found in forest patches with an open understory, urban neighborhoods with trees, and riverine corridors of cottonwood in the Great Plains regions. The fox squirrel measures 20 to 30 inches in length, with a body length of 10 to 15 inches and the tail about the same. On average, it is 21 inches long. It weighs one to 2.5 pounds with an average weight range of 1.6 to 2.3 pounds. Western species are smaller than those in other areas. All have several sensitive whiskers on each forearm, on their nose and chin, and above and below the eyes, which they use for sensory input from their environment. Identification of the sexes by outward appearance alone is impossible because they look the same and are the same size. As for colors, three possible types are depending on geography. Identification of fox squirrels in most areas by colors means brown-grey to brown-yellow with a brown-orange belly, while all have large, bushy tails. Identification of fox squirrels in eastern areas by colors shows dark brown and black squirrels with white bands on the tail and face. For example, the eastern fox squirrel has grey-black fur on its back and orange fur on its belly. Those in the South live in isolated communities and are black. The fox squirrel is a social mammal . Although it is a tree squirrel, it spends most of its time on the ground where it forages during the day. It is not territorial either, but it does use scent markings to communicate with other squirrels, and it does defend its nest. The female is the main sex that defends the nest with aggressive behavior, while the male can be aggressive during the season. Both are aggressive towards juvenile squirrels during young dispersal. In any residential area, the fox squirrel is likely to use electrical lines to travel which can cause power outages. Sometimes, it gnaws on telephone cables or gnaws holes into wooden buildings and invades attics. It can become a pest since it digs holes in gardens and turf to store acorns. It also eats nuts, fruits, and many other plants, and strips the outer bark of trees to eat the juicy inner bark. All of this behavior causes damage to lawns, gardens, and trees. North America is the native home of the fox squirrel. Its habitat range includes most of the eastern and central United States . Although it can live in various types of forests and residential areas, its typical habitat is open woodlands with mature trees but no dense canopy or undergrowth, usually large trees mixed in with agricultural land. As for the home it creates, it makes two different kinds: leaf nests, or dreys, and tree dens. It uses tree dens over the winter and while raising young, but if they are not available, it uses leaf nests throughout the year. The summer is when it builds leaf nests and it does so about 30 feet above the ground, using the forks of deciduous trees. The diameter of den trees can vary; on average, those in Ohio average diameter at breast height (fbh) of 21 inches and about 53.6 m (58.6 yards) away from the closest woodland border. Most tree dens in eastern Texas average a dbh of 12 inches or more. However, they are usually six inches wide and 14-16 inches deep. For this reason, overstory trees must have an average dbh of at least 15 inches. Tree canopy closure should be 20 to 60%, with understory closure of 30% or less shrub-crown closure. The fox squirrel usually uses natural cavities or cavities created by red-headed woodpeckers , northern flickers, or crow nests. The trees it uses are oaks, hickories, and occasionally pines. Not only is the fox squirrel tolerant of humans , but it can also thrive in suburban and even urban areas alike. It uses residential areas for food sources and nesting sites. Facts about the fox squirrel show that its diet is omnivorous . However, its main diet depends on geographic location. It generally eats insects , tree buds, mast, tubers, roots, bulbs, fungi, pine and spring-fruiting tree seeds, and bird eggs. It also eats fruit, wheat, oats, soybeans, and corn. The mast it eats is usually live oak, poak oak, bluejack oak, southern red oak, and turkey oak. On average, it eats about a pound of food a week. Predators of adult fox squirrels are large hawks , owls , bobcats , lynxes , foxes , and coyotes , while snakes prey on young squirrels. However, because few natural predators can catch them regularly, they are opportunistic hunters. Fox squirrels carry diseases such as ringworm , which they can transmit to humans. Mange mites, extreme winter weather, forest destruction, and overhunting are all threats to fox squirrel populations. This squirrel’s mating behavior starts with females, who go into estrus or “heat” in mid-December or early January as well as in June. As part of their typical squirrel mating behavior, they make “kuk” and “qua” moaning sounds before and after mating, and males chase them as a form of flirting. Females become sexually mature at 10 to 11 months and have their first litter at a year old. Yearling females have one litter, while older females have two per year. A litter can be born as early as January, but most are born in mid-March and July. Most females give birth in September or October, but with their second breeding season in winter can give birth again from February through May. They nurse their young in the nests for 2 months. There is an average of three juveniles in a litter with an average range of 2 to 4, although there can be anywhere from two to seven babies. The gestation period is 44 to 45 days. It is dependent on the squirrel species, with the gestation period ranging from less than a month to a month and a half. Plus, the time females go into estrus is individualized, so they don’t go into heat at the same time. Grey squirrels are very similar in their mating behavior and other habits and so interbreed where their geography overlaps. The lifespan of this squirrel species in the wild is poor, with many squirrels dying before they become adults due to the aforementioned threats. Females can live up to 12.6 years while males can live up to 8.6 years as their maximum lifespan. On average, they live for 6 years but in captivity can live up to 18 years. Facts about these squirrels show that they have the largest population of squirrels in North America, although the grey squirrel is more common with regard to habitat range and is more often seen. Certain subspecies, such as the Delmarva fox squirrel, are endangered due to overhunting and forest destruction, while mange mites and extreme winter weather cause squirrel populations in general to decline. However, the conservation status of the species is listed as stable and Least Concern ."

    "Name": "Olm",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that enjoys insects and especially likes larvae, worms, small fish, mollusks",
    "Text": "The olm is the longest-living amphibian and can live to be 100 years old! One of the most fascinating creatures in a world full of fascinating creatures, the olm, like its distant relative the axolotl , is a completely aquatic salamander with gills and tailfins. It is born, lives its long lifespan, and eventually dies in the water. The olm is endemic to the Dinaric Alps and can be found in the underground waters of the karst of central and southeastern Europe covering parts of Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as introduced populations in France and Germany. The olm’s scientific name is Proteus anguinus . Proteus comes from the Greek god who was able to change his shape at will, and anguinus comes from “anguis,” the Latin for “snake.” It is the only member of its genus Proteus and belongs to the Proteidae family of aquatic salamanders present in the Balkan Peninsula and North America. It is part of the same order, Urodela , as the similar-looking axolotl, which belongs to the Ambystoma genus. The olm is also commonly known as the proteus, cave salamander, and white salamander, with the local population referring to the animal as a “human fish.” See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Apart from the olm’s nominate subspecies Proteus anguinus anguinus , the black olm ( Proteus anguinus parkelj ) is the only subspecies recognized. The black olm was first discovered in 1986 by Slovenian Karst Research Institute members and is endemic to a region smaller than 39 square miles of underground waters near Črnomelj in Slovenia. The black olm differs from the olm in its appearance: most obviously, it is dark brown or black and usually pigmented, and it also has a shorter head and longer body with 34–35 vertebrae. The olm’s origins can be traced back millions of years. It is a member of the Proteidae family, which was divided from the Rhyacotritonidae family of salamanders more than 124 million years ago. It is the only member of the genus Proteus , which split more than 87 million years ago from the genus Necturus consisting of waterdogs or mudpuppies native to North America. The olm established its cave habitats around 8.8 million to 20 million years ago. This species was first referenced by naturalist Johann Weikhard von Valvasor in his 1689 book “The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola,” and referred to as a baby dragon following regional folkloric belief. Another naturalist, Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti, described it in 1768 and gave the olm its scientific name. Olms gained more attention over the years and were mentioned by Charles Darwin in “On the Origin of Species” published in 1859. The olm has adapted to its environment in several different ways, including its reproductive cycle being only around every 12.5 years and in its appearance, including having fewer digits than other amphibians. Another adaptation the olm has developed is to lower its metabolism in times when food sources are in short supply. It can even start to feed on its own tissues and olms are also thought to cannibalize each other now and then. For more on its adaptations, see the Appearance and Behavior sections below. As befitting its scientific name, the olm has a long, sinuous body like a pigmentless snake , with furrows at the edges of the skeletal muscles. It has a short, flattened tail that has a fin that helps the animal swim. The olm seems to be evolving out of its limbs because they are very small and losing digits. For example, there are three digits on the animal’s front legs whereas most salamanders have four. There are even fewer digits on its back legs. It only has two, while other salamanders have five. Its skin is so thin and pale that its viscera can be seen through its abdomen. The skin is also protected by a layer of mucous. The fuzzy gills are red. The olm’s head is long in proportion to its body, and it has a blunt snout and a small mouth with tiny teeth. Younger adult olms can be told from older ones because they may have yellow or red spots on their body, and their eyes are more easily seen. As the animal grows, its eyes deteriorate. Females are bigger than males, but it is hard to tell the sexes apart unless they are flipped over as the cloaca of the male is larger. Olms are gregarious save during the breeding season when both females and males stake out a territory. They gather in groups beneath rocks or crevices in the watery caves that are hard for people to access. They do not appear to migrate, and it’s not known how large an individual’s territory generally is. They are typically placid, and even males who are ready to breed are reluctant to fight. They usually simply display to drive away competitors. Because they basically can’t see and do not need to see, cave salamanders have developed adaptations that allow them to hunt prey. They are able to sense tiny amounts of organic matter and can even tell which prey it came from. They can hear well, and sounds are also picked up by the animal’s lateral line. This is a line that’s often found on the sides of aquatic animals such as fish. It helps the animal sense motion, differences in pressure, and vibrations. Olms also have excellent hearing, both in the water and on the ground. Other adaptations are a sharp sense of taste and heads that contain electrosensitive organs that can sense electrical fields. Though their vision is reduced, they can sense light and shy away from it. Some biologists believe the animal has light sensors in its skin. The olm is found in the watery caves of the Dinaric Alps near the Adriatic Sea, often at the entrances of the limestone caves. The waters are rich in oxygen, have a mildly acidic pH, and maintain temperatures of between 41 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit. The black olm subspecies lives in waters that are a bit warmer. The temperature of the water also determines how the salamander is born and how quickly or slowly the larva grows. Olms can be found as much as 984 feet deep in a cave, but rain can wash them into streams. The olm mostly eats insects , especially insects that hatch out of the water such as mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies, and insect larvae, but it will eat any prey it can catch and hold. It eats very small fish , worms, flies , and other small creatures such as the woodlouse, freshwater snails, and amphipods such as Niphargus . Also part of the olm’s diet are tiny fish and eggs. They will readily take bits of raw meat. It also eats detritus. Though it has tiny teeth, the cave salamander doesn’t chew but swallows its prey whole. It eats a great volume of food if it’s available and is able to store food to the point where it can go for years without eating. One of the adaptations the olm developed to deal with food scarcity is the ability to lower its metabolism. It can even start to feed on its own tissues. Olms are also thought to cannibalize each other now and then. While olm doesn’t have regular predators in its small habitat, it is threatened by human activity, even though humans have strived to preserve it by law for close to 100 years. It is sensitive to pollutants such as fertilizers and pesticides, and it is collected, illegally, for the pet trade. Now and then an olm will be eaten by a fish or other animal that got lost in its cave or will be eaten by another olm. People have only seen olms breed in captivity. They only breed once every 12.5 years, and both sexes are not reproductively mature until they are about 14 years old. During this time, males claim a territory and defend it as they wait for a female to pass by. The sexes can be told apart at this time because the male’s cloaca is swollen and he has lines along his tail, his fins are a little curled, and the color of his skin is brighter. When a female enters the male’s territory, they have a courtship ritual that ends with him depositing a packet of sperm and her taking it up into her cloaca and storing the sperm in a spermatheca. Then, the sperm fertilizes her eggs. Females only mate with one male but males mate with more than one female. The female olm then establishes her own territory at a distance from the male’s. She carries the fertilized eggs for two to three days and then starts to lay them under a rock. She can lay eggs for as long as 25 days. There are usually between 35 and 70 eggs. They are 0.16 to 0.2 inches around at first then swell up to 0.31 to 0.35 inches as they take on water. The female guards them for two to six months. The temperature of the water plays a role in determining when the eggs hatch. Eggs incubated in colder temperatures hatch later than eggs incubated in warmer temperatures. When the eggs hatch the larvae, which are about 0.8 inches long, are independent. The olm tadpoles don’t undergo metamorphosis but are smaller versions of their parents. Some scientists believe that a proteus can give birth to live larvae if the water is cold and only lays eggs when the water is a bit warmer, but this is anecdotal. Olms can live on average for around 68 years in the wild, but it’s estimated that they are capable of living for more than 100 years. It’s thought they live so long due to the cool water of its environment and its slow metabolism. Scientists believe there are at least 400 olms in the world. Their habitat makes them difficult to study, but they are bred in captivity in Germany and France and can be seen at Croatia’s Zagreb Zoo . The olm is classified as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List."

    "Text": "A trout is not a single species. The name trout refers to a type of freshwater fish that lives in cold rivers and lakes all over the world. Trout are native to North America , Europe , and other parts of the world. Most trout species fall into one of three categories: freshwater, saltwater, and anadromous. Anadromous trout spend time in salt water, but they return to freshwater streams to spawn. • Trout is one of the most popular game fish in the world. • This fish thrives in cold, clean water. • Trout don’t have scales in their first month of life. • Trout that live in different places have different color patterns. • Cooked trout is a delicious, nutrient-rich dish. The name “trout” is commonly used for some species in three of the seven genera in the subfamily Salmonidae: Salmo, Oncorhynchus or Salvelinus. The Salvelinus genus also includes fish referred to as char or salmon . Some species that belong to the trout family include the following. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Salmo genus: • Adriatic trout (Salmo obtusirostris) • Brown trout (Salmo trutta) • River trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario) Oncorhynchus genus: • Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) • Colorado River cutthroat trout (O.c. pleuricius) • Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Salvelinus genus: • Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) • Dolly Valden trout (Salvelinus malma) • Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) Rainbow trout are naturally found in the North Pacific Ocean and connected river systems extending from the Amur River in eastern Asia, stretching northward along the Pacific coast encompassing the Kamchatka Peninsula and northeastern regions of Russia, as well as along the Pacific coast of North America spanning from Alaska to northern Mexico. Trout are naturally found across North America, northern Asia, and Europe, and were later introduced to Australia and New Zealand by recreational anglers during the 19th century. This introduction had the unintended consequence of displacing and threatening various native fish species in upland areas. There are 14 species of trout. There are 13 species of freshwater trout, which includes three hybrid species, and one saltwater species. The 9 species native to North America are: • Brook • Bull • Dolly Varden • Cutthroat • Gila • Brown • Lake • Apache • Golden • Rainbow The 3 hybrid trout species are: • Palomino (also known as the golden rainbow) • Tiger • Splake Are you wondering about the brown trout? It is not native to North America. It is native to Asia and Europe, and it was introduced to North America in the 1800s. Knowing what fish you’re talking about can be a little confusing when you talk about a fish this widespread and popular. For instance, brook trout is a recognized species in the U.S., but it is also another name for the European trout, which is native to the U.K. In parts of the U.S., brook trout are known as specked mud trout. The steelhead trout (Onchorynkus mykiss) is sometimes confused with the rainbow trout. They are not the same fish, but a steelhead is an anadromous form of the coastal rainbow trout (o.m. irideus) or the Columbia River red band trout (o.m. gairdneri). Steelhead trout usually have thinner bodies and more silver coloring than freshwater rainbow trout. A trout is a large fish whose colors can vary depending on where it lives and what type of trout it is. It has a long, oval body, a small head, small eyes, and a mouth that stretches back across its body. Its most distinctive feature is a dorsal fin with iridescent spotting in various colors. It is usually dark with silvery-gray scales on its sides. On average, trout can reach 2 feet in length, but their size varies by species. Anadromous species are usually larger than freshwater species. Their colors also vary according to species and location. Freshwater rainbow trout, for instance, are known for their bright pink and purple colors, while steelhead trout are almost solid silver. Brown trout get their name from their spotted sides, and tiger trout have dark, distinctive stripes. Trout prefer cold lakes, rivers, and streams. Their ideal temperature is 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit. They are among the most common fish in northern wilderness areas. Freshwater species may spend their entire lives in the streams or rivers where they were born. Others are migratory. They travel to the ocean, spend time there, and then return to the place of their birth to reproduce. The exact population number is unknown, but most populations are considered stable. Trout are an important food source for humans and animals. Some carnivores that eat trout include bears , eagles , otters , sawbill ducks , and larger fish like pike . Trout are carnivores who feed on a wide variety of fish and aquatic animals. They will even eat mice and voles that fall into the water. Their diet includes: • Crayfish • Minnows • Flies • Mollusks • Smaller fish • Shrimp • Dragonflies • Worms • Snails • Grasshoppers Male trout reach sexual maturity at two years old, and females reach it at three years. Males attract females by changing their scale colors to bright pink or red. They reproduce by spawning. The female first builds a nest by scooping out dirt and sediment to create a nesting area called a redd. Normally, she chooses a river bottom that has some gravel and sand. She deposits her eggs in the nest, and the male releases his sperm on top of the eggs. A trout can lay 200 to 8,000 eggs in a single spawning. After 4 to 10 weeks, the eggs hatch. Many baby trout won’t survive. Most trout in the wild die before their first birthday. Male trout can become aggressive when fighting over females and when defending their redds. Cooked trout is a favorite among people who like seafood. Although trout tends to be bony, most people find it delicious. The meat changes from pink to white once it’s cooked. It is extremely tender with a delicate flavor. It is easy to cut and file. There are endless ways to cook trout, including grilling, smoking, baking, and pan-frying. Most culinary experts say a simple recipe makes the best-cooked trout. This allows the trout’s natural flavor to shine. Simple seasoning and grilling are all you need to make a spectacular trout filet. Any recipe that calls for salmon will work with trout. Trout is classed as an “oily” fish, which means it is high in omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association and other nutrition experts recommend eating oily fish for their nutrients and fatty acids. Trout is low in calories and fat. They are also popular as game fish. Trout fishing is second only to bass fishing as the most popular type of fishing. The technique of fly fishing was developed specifically to catch trout in rivers. People who like ice fishing frequently hope to catch trout. In winter, trout stay close to the water surface looking for food, and this makes it easier to catch them. Rainbow and brown trout are the most common targets of ice fishing. Trout tickling is an ancient way of catching these fish that doesn’t involve a rod, reel, or net. It involves stroking the trout until it falls into a trance. In Scotland, it’s called guddling. Trout tickling is illegal in most countries because it’s usually associated with poaching. Trout is listed as least concern by the IUCN Redlist and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. As a popular game fish, trout populations are regularly restocked by fishery departments in countries all over the world. In recent years, however, conservationists have expressed concern about the fate of trout and other fish. Climate change has a direct impact on the cold temperatures these fish need to thrive. Wildlife biologists in some areas are concerned about the population losses of trout native to those regions. Habitat loss, water pollution, and rising temperatures have affected trout populations. Trout are among the most sought-after and beloved fish among fishers who enjoy the challenge of catching them. Immortalized in books and movies about fishing, they are symbols of the wild, cold wilderness."

    "Name": "Lake Trout",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats plankton, insects, aquatic invertebrates, fish",
    "Text": "The lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) is a large freshwater fish native to North America . Contrary to popular belief, it is not actually a true trout . In reality, they belong to the char family. These prized game fish can grow to enormous sizes. They also grow quite slowly, which can make them susceptible to overfishing. The lake trout belongs to the ray-finned class of fish Actinopterygii. Its family, Salmonidae, includes several well-known freshwater fish, including salmon, char, trout, graylings, and lenoks. All members of the Salmonidae family collectively go by the name salmonids, or “salmon-like fish.” The fish’s genus name, Salvelinus, is a Latinized version of the German word saibling, meaning “a char.” Meanwhile, its specific name namaycush derives from the word namekush. Several Southern East Cree tribes in Canada and around Hudson Bay used this word when referring to them. However, some other East Cree used different names, including kukamaw and kukamesh. The Ojibwe-speaking people of the Great Lakes also had their own names for them. Some of the most common Ojibwe names included namegos (lake trout) and namegoshens (little lake trout). Most of their other common names stem from English or French versions of Native American words. For example, the name mackinaw stems from the Algonquin word mitchimakinak , meaning “many turtles.” This word was later adopted for the Michigan port city of “Mackinaw” and, subsequently, the lake trout. Similarly, the French-Canadian word touladi stems from an Eastern Algonquian word for lake trout. On the other hand, some nicknames for them are based solely on their appearance. For instance, some anglers call dark-colored lake trout “mud hens” due to their large size and dark appearance. The lake trout ranks as the largest species of freshwater char . On average, adults measure between 24 and 36 inches long. Anglers commonly catch them weighing anywhere from 15 to 40 pounds. However, given enough time (and food), they can grow to a truly humongous size. The largest lake trout on record weighed almost 102 pounds and clocked in at nearly 50 inches long. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Lake trout possess a noticeably forked tail. Their scales typically range from slate gray to light green on the sides and appear lighter on the belly. However, some specimens can appear dark green, brown, or gray. They feature yellow or cream-colored spots all across the head, body, and fins. In terms of overall appearance, they resemble other salmon, trout, or char. Lake trout are native to North America. Traditionally, they lived in a narrow range throughout Canada, Alaska , and the northeastern United States . In the 19th and 20th centuries, fisheries introduced these fish into new habitats. Today, you can find them in parts of Europe , Asia , and South America . Lake trout were also legally introduced into the Shoshone, Heart, and Lewis Lakes in Yellowstone National Park. However, in the 1980s, they were illegally introduced into Yellowstone Lake, where they are now considered an invasive species. Lake trout prefer cold, oxygen-rich freshwater lakes. They tend to inhabit relatively deep water, particularly during the summer. You can often find them at depths ranging from 60 to 200 feet below the surface. Lake trout normally fill a spot near the top of the food chain in whatever habitat they occupy. As juveniles, they primarily feed on aquatic insects such as mayflies, caddis flies, and midges. They also prey on plankton, terrestrial insects , worms , leeches , and aquatic invertebrates. Mature lake trout will eat just about anything that they can catch. They possess voracious appetites and eat a wide variety of prey, including crustaceans and small fish. Typical prey fish include smelt, minnows, and sculpin . In Yellowstone Lake, they frequently prey on native cutthroat trout. This predatory habit of feeding on cutthroat trout is one of the main reasons people consider them an invasive species in that environment. Since they often inhabit pelagic waters, few mammals , reptiles , and amphibians prey on them. As a result, the only animals that frequently prey on them are other large, predatory fish and birds of prey. Juvenile and mature lake trout share many of the same predators. Aside from humans, some common predators of theirs include eagles , muskies, and northern pike. Most spawn at night during the fall. However, spawning conditions and timing may change depending on the weather and environment. They spawn via broadcast spawning, wherein females spread millions of eggs over several spawning shoals. Males then come by and externally fertilize the eggs with their sperm. The eggs take anywhere from 4 to 6 months to hatch. Young lake trout, known as fry, tend to hide near the lake bed until they grow larger enough to move into open water to hunt. In the wild, these fish mature at different rates depending on their environment. Experts separate lake trout into two broad categories: planktivorous trout and piscivorous trout. Planktivorous variants live in lakes that lack pelagic forage fish. These trout mature slowly and tend not to grow especially large. Meanwhile, piscivorous variants live in lakes that do contain deep-water food sources. Piscivorous lake trout typically mature much more quickly and can grow to an enormous size. They also tend to be far less abundant than planktivorous lake trout. On the far end of the spectrum, long-lived lake trout can reach over 20 years old. You can cook lake trout in various ways, including baked, grilled, fried, or boiled. That said, the most popular ways to cook this fish include grilling and baking. They have a strong, fishy taste that is more pronounced than salmon or whitefish. Due to this strong flavor, some people shy away from cooking it. However, you can reduce its flavor by first bleeding and soaking the fish. It possesses juicy, firm meat, so if you like eating other freshwater fish, you’ll probably enjoy it. Populations of this fish vary by region. In Lake Superior, their numbers declined during the late 19th century and early 20th century due to overharvest. However, thanks to strong regulations, their numbers rebounded in the 1970s. According to some experts, approximately 100 million of them live in Lake Superior. Today, commercial fisheries continue to harvest them in the Great Lakes. However, fishing is more tightly controlled today than in earlier decades. Still, native populations are under threat in a number of lakes throughout Canada and the northern United States. As a result, the General Status of Alberta Wild Species report lists them as a Sensitive species."

    "Name": "Common Loon",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that enjoys fish and especially likes frogs, insects",
    "Text": "“An underwater hunting expert” Though awkward on land, the common loon bird is a graceful hunter on the water. This mostly cold-weather waterfowl learns to dive before it learns to fly and will come back to the same nest with the same mate every year for almost a decade. The bird has found its way into a number of Native North American legends and is also the face of the Canadian one-dollar coin. Though pollution eliminated common loons in much of eastern North America, this fowl thrives in Canada, particularly. Though the name “loon” comes from its goofy walk, it’s probably described better by its other English name: “Great Northern Diver.” The scientific name for the common loon, also known as “Great Northern Diver,” is gavia immer . “ Gavia ” comes from the Latin term for seabird, and “ immer ” could be from the Norwegian word for “ash” (for its appearance) or the Latin words “ immergo ” or “ immersus “, meaning “submerged” or “diving.” As a member of the genus Gavia, the common loon’s closest relatives are: black-throated, red-throated, Pacific, and yellow-billed loons. This family of birds is believed to date back to the Paleogene era which took place between 23 – 66 million years ago. During the Miocene which occurred between 5.3 – 23 million years ago, the ancestors of the genus extended along the coasts of the Atlantic, until they eventually reached the Pacific coast. An undertaking which would only reach its end by the late part of the period.Fossil evidence of the ancestors of the genus can be found dating back to the Miocene, the Pliocene, and the Pleistocene. The Gavia brodkorbi dating back to the Middle to Late Miocene (the Clarendonian age), discovered in California, is one such example. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The loon looks like many other ducks, except its bill is more pointed, like a songbird. Its feathers are mostly black, with an almost grid-like pattern of white spots across its wings and throat and a white underbelly. Common loon sounds are well-known to people who live near their habitats. These include a distinctive yodel, a wailing sound, and a hooting noise. The common loon call is used to find a mate or declare a nesting site. The feet of a common loon are set further back on its body than other water birds. This makes them excellent swimmers and divers. However, it looks awkward whenever it walks on land. That silly-looking walk is believed to be why it earned the name “loon.” Its unique feet also make it land differently from other ducks. While most ducks land on water by skimming their feet, common loons have to skim on their belly. Common loons are birds that prefer colder areas close to water. They are most often found throughout Canada and are common in New England. In addition to Canada, loons are common to Alaska, Greenland, Iceland , and Scotland. They tend to live near smaller ponds during the summer, when they nest, and migrate to larger lakes and coastal areas during the winter. The common loon eats lots of fish. It is an expert at diving into the water to hunt. The specific fish a common loon eats depends on where it spends most of its time. For loons near coastal areas, dinner means flounder , herring, rockfish, and sea trout. Meanwhile, common loons near fresh water will eat bass, perch, pike , sunfish and trout. To hunt, a common loon will first poke its head under the surface of the water. Once it sees its prey prey, it can dive as deep as 200 feet! Smaller fish can be gulped whole, while larger fish are carried to a place where they can be eaten. Common Loons may be attacked by bald eagles. The process of fishing out in the open water also places them at risk of sharks’ razor-sharp fangs. Other predators which pose a threat to their existence include minks, foxes, and otters. Ravens and gulls may also decide to help themselves to their eggs. Humans stand as the biggest threat to loons, though the threat is not severe. Water pollution has caused common loons to disappear from eastern North America. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s lists the common loon as “least concern,” meaning it is not currently at risk of disappearing. Common loons can also risk having their eggs taken by small mammals. It may change nesting sites when this happens. Toxic water poses a threat to the common loon, because it prefers the same kind of water in which it was born. That means that a common loon hatched on a polluted lake will, according to some research , seek out a similarly polluted lake when it nests later in life. It will seek this type of lake, even if that lake has fewer fish or is worse for hatching new chicks. Common loons breed monogamously, meaning the same male and female will breed every year. Common loons live for about 10 years and will breed once a year for most of their lives. Each year, a common loon female will produce two baby loons or chicks. This is much less than typical water birds. A female mallard duck, for example, will lay as many as 13 eggs each year. Common loons will generally build a nest near the edge of water mostly out of sticks, reeds, and grass. They use the same nest, or nesting site, every year. The male might move the nest if eggs are lost to predators. Common loons begin breeding at age two. They will find a mate during early summer and the two will stake off a nesting site by circling it overhead and making a yodeling noise. The mother will typically lay two eggs. Common loon eggs will sit for almost a month before hatching, with both parents taking turns sitting on the eggs. After hatching, both mother and father feed the chicks while they are growing. It will take the chicks nearly three months to learn to fly, but less than a week to swim and dive. The male and female will migrate separately to winter quarters after the chicks have grown. The two then return to the same breeding ground at the start of each summer. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates as many as 640,000 common loons exist worldwide. Most of these loons are located in North America, particularly in Canada. About 2,600 common loons are estimated to live in Europe. While the population seemed to be growing slightly in North America, the IUCN said it is declining in Europe."

    "Name": "Black Footed Ferret",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats prairie dogs, ground squirrels, birds, insects",
    "Text": "“The black-footed ferret is the only ferret native to North America” The habitat of Black-footed ferrets includes a range extending over the plains of Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, and Arizona. They are carnivores with a diet consisting mostly of prairie dogs. These mammals have a long, sleek body that allows them to easily fit into tunnels and burrows. They are solitary animals with a lifespan of 3 to 4 years in the wild. Mustela nigripes is the scientific name of the black-footed ferret. Mustela is a Latin word meaning weasel while nigripes translates to black-footed. This animal is sometimes called an American polecat . It belongs to the Mustelidae family and the class Mammalia. The black-footed ferret has a long, slender bod y with white to cream-colored fur on its back along with black feet and a black-tipped tail. One of the most notable facts about its appearance is the black fur on its face that makes it look like it’s wearing a mask. This ferret aka American polecat measures 18 to 24 inches in length with a tail 5 to 6 inches long. An adult black-footed ferret weighs an average of 2 pounds. Males are normally bigger than females. As a comparison, a 24-inch-long ferret is equal to 11 golf tees lined up end to end. A 2-pound black-footed ferret is equal in weight to 1 ½ basketball. The heaviest black-footed ferret weighs in at 2.5 pounds. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The black-footed ferret has many adaptations that help it to survive in its habitat. For one, its wiry, slender body allows it to slip into a prairie dog burrow in pursuit of its prey. Its large eyes help this mammal to see in the dark. Another one of its amazing adaptations is a strong sense of smell. This ferret finds prey and navigates its environment by detecting the scents all around it. The cream-colored coat of this ferret helps it to blend into its habitat so it can hide from predators. This animal’s sharp claws are used to dig into the ground to create a new burrow or expand an existing one. A strong jaw helps this ferret to capture and hold a prairie dog. When one ferret spots a predator near its burrow, the animal starts to chatter and hiss to signal danger to other ferrets nearby. Black-footed ferrets are solitary animals. But, when they do form a group it’s called a business. There are usually 3 or more ferrets in a business. These mammals are shy but may become aggressive during mating season. Black-footed ferrets are part of the large Mustelid family which itself consists of 55 species. Included in that family are mink, otters, and weasels. A common feature most members share is an elongated, slender body, comparatively short legs and a small head with a short snout, and a preference for a carnivorous diet. Ferrets’ earliest known ancestor Mustela stromeri is believed to have also been the forbear of two mid-Pleistocene subspecies, Mustela eversmanni and M. putorius. Black-footed ferrets are believed to have emerged about 2 million years ago developing a preference for a diet of prairie dogs after evolving simultaneously with them over millennia. They are also believed to have already been living in North America, by the Late Paleolithic, about 100,000 years ago. Decades ago, the population of the black-footed ferret was so low the species was thought to be extinct. Their numbers were greatly decreased by a plague that ran through the prairie dog population. It is known as the sylvatic plague and is carried by fleas . It kills 90 percent of the prairie dogs that become infected. When the prairie dog population goes down it takes away the main component in the diet of the black-footed ferrets. As a result, these ferrets began to die off in large numbers. Habitat loss is another reason why the population of the black-footed ferret has fallen so low. Expansion of farmland destroys many of the prairie dog burrows where these ferrets live . One of the most amazing facts is a small population of black-footed ferrets was discovered in 1981. With the help of captive breeding programs and more community education, this ferret’s population slowly began to increase. However, officially, the black-footed ferret is still Endangered . Black-footed ferrets are native to North America . They live in a range that includes Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, and South Dakota. They live in a temperate location of plains and grasslands. These ferrets don’t migrate. But, they do spend more time in their burrows during the winter season. These animals are carnivores. The diet of this ferret consists mainly of prairie dogs. In fact, this prairie dog hunter eats approximately 100 of these rodents in the course of a year! If one prairie dog weighs 3 pounds, that means a black-footed ferret eats 300 pounds of prairie dogs per year. Imagine, 300 pounds is equal to nine-tenths the weight of a panda bear . Golden eagles , owls , coyotes , bobcats , and badgers are all predators of these animals. Most of these predators are nocturnal as well. An owl flying over the plains can easily see the movements of a black-footed ferret and swoop down to capture one. Or, a bobcat can choose a location near the burrow of a black-footed ferret and wait until it ventures out looking for food at night. Prairie dogs make up the biggest part of the diet of these animals. This is why this animal is known as an expert prairie dog hunter! They also may eat ground squirrels , mice , rats , rabbits , reptiles , birds , and sometimes insects . The conservation status of the black-footed ferret is Endangered. When its main diet of prairie dogs decreases, the population of ferrets goes down as well. Also, this ferret is threatened by habitat loss due to land development. They are sometimes killed by farmers who consider them pests that may go after their chickens and smaller livestock. There are conservation actions being taken now to protect this ferret. These actions include captive breeding and educating the public about these unique animals. The breeding season of these animals happens in March and April. In this species, female ferrets compete for males. The gestation period of a female is 41 to 43 days. They give live birth to 3 to 4 babies also called kits. The female ferret cares for the kits in the burrow after they are born. The male doesn’t play a part in the care of the young. Newborn ferrets weigh from 0.2 to 0.3 ounces. They are born with their eyes closed and have a thin coat of white hair. They are mostly helpless until their eyes open. In about 3 weeks, they begin to get black markings on their fur, and their eyes open at 35 days old. After being weaned at around 3 months old, the kits begin to venture out of their underground location as their mother teaches them how to hunt for food. They stay with their mother for about 5 or 6 months before going off to live independently. The lifespan of these animals is 3 to 4 years. The record for the oldest black-footed ferret is 9 years. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the population of these animals consists of 206 mature individuals. The conservation status of this ferret is endangered , and they have a decreasing population."

    "Name": "Western Kingbird",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, arachnids",
    "Text": "“Western kingbirds have hidden red crown feathers that they can raise when threatened!” The western kingbird is a large species of tyrant flycatcher native to North America. They are aggressive when necessary and are known to chase away other birds that tread too close. This includes larger birds of prey, like red-tailed hawks. They are common in rural backyards, and, though they typically eat a diet of invertebrates, they may occasionally eat berries as well. The western kingbird is native only to North America. They reside in the western region of the continent, although they winter as far east as Costa Rica and Florida. During the breeding season, you can find them in the northernmost extent of their range, from northern Mexico up to southern Canada. They winter in Florida and along the southernmost coasts of Mexico and Central America, with their migratory locations spanning the gap between winter and breeding grounds. This species is often found in open grasslands, or on woodland edges near these habitats. However, they also have a tendency to reside in human structures, building their nests on utility poles, fence posts, and similar areas. As of now, it is unclear whether the male or the female in the breeding pair will choose the nesting location. However, what is known is that both individuals will visit potential nesting locations. Typical areas for the western kingbird to build its nest include different trees, such as cottonwood or pecan trees, as well as man-made structures. While it isn’t known which of the pair chooses the nesting location, the female is responsible for constructing the nest. She weaves together a variety of different plant materials, including bark, rootlets, and stems, to create an open cup. Once the skeleton of the nest is made, the female will line the inside of the nest with soft material. This includes wool, feathers, and cloth. The final nest measures around 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, although the usable, inner cup of the nest is half that size. The scientific name of the western kingbird is Tyrannus verticalis . It is in the class Aves , which contains all species of birds, and in the order Passeriformes . It is in the family Tyrannidae , which is the family of tyrant flycatchers. The western kingbird is a large flycatcher lacking sexual dimorphism. This means that males and females of the species look the same. They sport grey heads, with pale throats and a yellow belly. The tail is black with the outer feathers being white. Both sexes of this species sport a reddish-orange crown. These colorful feathers are located around the top of the head and are often concealed by the outer grey feathers. The adult western kingbird will grow to be 7.9 to 9.4 inches in length. On average, they weigh 1.3 to 1.6 ounces. What is most impressive is their wingspan, which is often between 15.0 and 16.1 inches. These birds are most often seen perching. Weather on natural structures, such as trees or shrubs, are man-made structures such as fences, they often sit and watch for nearby prey and predators. They capture their prey while flying, whether that includes capturing a nearby, airborne insect or plucking one from the ground or plants while hovering. They are aggressive only in that they are territorial. They will defend their territory using a variety of calls and gestures. When necessary, they may also attack intruders in their territory, as is often the case when encountering crows. The western kingbird is a medium- to long-distance migrant with no significant year-round populations. They begin their southward migration at the end of the summer period. This species winters most often in Mexico and Central America, along with the southernmost tip of the Florida panhandle. Prior to arriving in their winter grounds, they will stop along the route, appearing in states such as New Mexico and Arizona. Come spring, these birds will migrate north again for the breeding season, often appearing in the same migratory states as they did when traveling southward. Like other species of tyrant flycatchers, the western kingbird is primarily an insectivore. They hunt in the air during the day, often catching more than one insect to return to their perch with. Not only do they catch insects in flight, but they may also occasionally pluck terrestrial prey from the ground as well as from plants while hovering. Although insects make up the majority of their diet, they may also eat certain plant materials, namely berries. Other invertebrates, such as arachnids, are often consumed. Some of the plant and animal matter western kings will consume include: Although western kingbirds gain benefits from human influence, such as additional perching and nesting locations, there are also several threats they face as a result of humans. One of the main threats is agricultural pollution. As insectivores, these flycatchers consume a large number of invertebrates, and their fondness for open spaces often leaves them hunting near crop fields. This can result in these kingbirds consuming animals affected by pesticides. There are also natural threats. This includes those such as storms and predators. Western kingbirds may fall prey to a variety of different animals. This includes Western kingbird pairs are monogamous. Males will arrive at the breeding grounds first, and, once mated, will defend the territory with the female. Together, the pair will protect and raise their young, remaining nearby to help the fledglings up to three weeks after they leave the nest. For the rest of the year, western kingbirds are solitary. These birds can lay anywhere from 2 to 7 eggs. These eggs are small, averaging at 0.9 inches in length and 0.7 inches in width. The outer shell of the egg is white or pinkish, with large blotches in colors such as brown, black, or even lavender. The incubation period for the western kingbird is 12 to 19 days. The hatchlings will emerge with their eyes closed and only a sparse covering of down, rendering them helpless without their parents. The nesting period lasts 12 to 19 days, after which the young fledge and leave the nest. However, as mentioned above, the parents will continue to help the young kingbirds for up to three weeks after this point. During their southward migration to their wintering habitats, adults will undergo a complete molt. This species has an average lifespan of around 6 years. The western kingbird is a species of least concern . Between 1966 and 2019, they maintained an overall stable population with no significant, long-term inclines or declines. It is estimated that the global breeding population totals around 30 million. The largest changes in this species’ population are often seen on a local level rather than global. Temporary changes, such as an increase in predation or natural disasters, can impact birds in that area without harming the total population. Western kingbirds have also proven an ability to rebound quickly after declines, allowing them to maintain their population."

    "Name": "White Bass",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats smaller fish, crustaceans, insects and especially likes opportunistic feeder",
    "Text": "The white bass is a freshwater fish native to North America, and although it is often hunted for food, many people dislike its distinctive fishy taste. The white bass is a freshwater fish that is native to North America. It is a popular game fish and is often consumed as food. It is found in lakes and rivers and can grow up to 12 inches in length. The white bass is an important fish and is quite popular among anglers. This fish has a silver-white body with dark vertical stripes. Its diet consists of smaller fish, insects, and crustaceans. It spawns in the spring, and the female can lay up to 500,000 eggs. Morone chrysops is commonly known as the white bass , the sand bass, and the silver bass. It is unknown where the word “morone” comes from, but “chrysops” is the Greek word for “golden eye.” The white bass’s scientific name refers to the yellow eye of the fish. This fish has a silver-white body with dark stripes running along its sides. It typically grows to be about 12 inches long and weighs 1-2 pounds. The belly of the fish is usually white or pale yellow. The back and upper sides of the fish are typically darker than the rest of the body. It is a relatively small fish; however, some individuals have been known to grow up to 18 inches in length and weigh four pounds. The white bass has undergone several evolutionary changes over the years. For example, it was once believed to be a direct descendant of the striped bass. However, recent DNA evidence has shown that this is not the case. Instead, it appears that the white bass and striped bass are more closely related to each other than they are to any other fish species. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . In addition, scientists have also found evidence that suggests these fish may have evolved from two different ancestral populations. One of these populations was in what is now the eastern U.S., while the other was located in what is now western Canada. This evidence comes from a study of mitochondrial DNA, which showed two distinct genetic lineages within the white bass population. Overall, this fish has undergone many evolutionary changes over time. However, further research is needed to understand its evolutionary history completely. These fish are known for their aggressive behavior and are often considered one of the most challenging fish to catch. They are highly migratory and travel long distances searching for food or spawning grounds. This makes them difficult to track and study. Despite their aggressive nature, they are popular among anglers due to their fighting ability when hooked. They are also considered good for eating, with a milder flavor than some other freshwater fish. The white bass is found in lakes, rivers, and streams throughout the U.S. It prefers clear waters with little or no vegetation. The white bass spawns when water temperatures reach 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the springtime. After spawning, the adults move into deeper waters, where they actively spend the summer months feeding. In the fall, it migrates back to shallower waters. This fish prefers clear water with a moderate current. It is an opportunistic feeder and will eat a variety of food items, including insects, small fish, crustaceans, and baitfish. In terms of temperature, the white bass prefers colder waters but can also tolerate warmer temperatures if necessary. They are known to be reasonably migratory creatures, moving around in large schools in search of food. This makes them a popular target for fishermen, as they can be relatively easy to catch in large numbers. The white bass is an opportunistic feeder and will eat various foods available, including insects, small fish, and crustaceans. White bass are predators and feed on these creatures due to their hunting ability. They are also known to eat other white basses when lacking food, making them difficult to keep together in captivity. They are opportunistic feeders, making them very adaptable to different environments. However, their diet does vary depending on where they live. For example, white bass that live in streams tends to eat more insects than those living in lakes. Overall, the diet of the white bass is quite varied. They can adapt to different environments and eat whatever readily available food. Some predators include large birds and large marine animals, such as other bass species and birds like herons and gulls. They are also preyed upon by other white bass and humans. They will eat whatever is available but mainly insects, small fish, and crustaceans. The white bass is prized for its fighting ability and delicious taste. However, this fish has its predators and threats too. The main predators of the white bass are other fish, such as the largemouth bass and the smallmouth bass. These fish often eat smaller white bass or prey on them when spawning. Birds such as gulls, loons, cormorants, and herons will also feed on white bass. There are also several human-related threats to their population. Overfishing is a significant problem for this species as they are often caught for sport or food. Pollution and habitat destruction can also negatively impact the white bass population. Despite these challenges, they remain a popular sport fish due to their abundance in many areas and their tasty flesh. With proper management and conservation efforts, we can ensure that this species continues to thrive for generations. White bass reproduce in late spring when water temperatures reach 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit. A female can lay up to 500,000 eggs per season. During this time, the fish will migrate to shallow waters where they will spawn. The female will release her eggs into the water, and the male will then fertilize them. After spawning has occurred, the parents will return to deeper waters. Their eggs are adhesive, meaning they will stick to objects in the water, such as rocks or plants. Once hatched, the larvae of the fish are tiny and are difficult to see with the naked eye. They will remain in shallow waters until they reach a larger size, at which point they will move into deeper waters where they will live for the rest of their lives. The fry (baby fish) hatch within two days and grow fast, reaching sexual maturity within 2-3 years and reaching adulthood within one year. The young fish will feed on small insects and other organisms. The fry will then search for schools for protection. At this point, they will start to move into open water, feeding on small crustaceans, insects, and larvae. The fry can reach lengths of 10 inches within their first year. These fish have an average lifespan of 4-5 years. They are known to be hardy fish and can withstand a wide range of water conditions. The main factors that affect the lifespan are water quality, diet, and predation pressure. In wild populations, predation pressure is also a significant factor affecting mortality rates. Some threats include: The white bass is a popular game fish, and they are also commercially harvested. The estimated global population of this species is around 10 million. However, there is no reliable estimate for the total number of white bass in the wild. The population numbers of this species have likely declined in recent years due to overfishing and habitat loss. The exact extent of these declines is unknown. Despite these challenges, it remains an integral part of the ecosystem and economy in many parts of North America. This is one of the most popular fish to catch, as it is also a tasty treat for an angler after a long day by the shores. There are many ways to prepare it, including grilling, smoking, or deep frying. You can pan-fry this fish with light seasoning to bring out the flavor. Although the fillets will be relatively smaller compared to other popular game fish, the white bass can still be a good meal with some hearty sides and white wine. The taste of this fish is often compared to that of crappie but with a completely different texture. White bass can taste a little fishy, so many people avoid eating this fish. However, with that said, the taste can easily be masked by cooking the fish correctly. The best way to prepare the fish is to grill it with good seasoning and breading. This fish also has a high oil content, making it flaky and moist, but it is not as oily as cod."

    "Name": "Agkistrodon Contortrix",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats insects, rodents, birds, rabbits",
    "Text": "Agkistrodon contortrix , also known as the eastern copperhead snake , is a venomous type of viper snake native to forests throughout the eastern North American continent. Easily distinguishable by its vibrant copperhead with hourglass shape markings, this snake differs from other vipers by “freezing” when they encounter humans. That said, they still bite more people than any other snake in America because their camouflage is so effective that people will accidentally step on them! Read on to learn more about this bronze-colored, beautiful snake. The Agkistrodon contortrix is native to North America and found in the deciduous forest regions of the United States. The snake resides as far north as Massachusetts, south as Georgia, and west as northern Mexico and Texas. Due to its broad geographical range, the species has adapted to suit a variety of habitats, including mixed woodlands, river edges, rocky cliffsides, and even the edges of wetlands. Some have been found near human habitation in construction sites or rural, dirt-laden regions. During hibernation, snakes curl up in logs, caves, and crevices to stay warm and safe from would-be predators. This is the snake’s scientific name and Agkistrodon contortrix is loosely translated as “fishhook-toothed snake” with “twisted” designs. The word Agkistrodon comes from the Greek term ancistro , meaning “hooked,” and odon , translated to “tooth.” The second word Contortrix has a Latin origin in the phrase contortus , which means “twisted” or “intricate.” This refers to the twisting, hourglass-like patterns on the copperhead’s back that are an identifying characteristic. The most common name people know for this snake is the copperhead. There are four subspecies of Agkistrodon contortrix , but the most common one is the Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen , found in the southern United States and as northward as Massachusetts’ forests. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The eastern copperhead is a common snake in its territorial range with a conservation status of most minor concern. The copper-colored head and lovely, dark-brown hourglass designs on its body are the Agkistrodon contortrix’s most defining characteristics. Other snakes sport similar colors, but the hourglass shape bands set the eastern copperhead apart from its fellow vipers. Agkistrodon contortrix are smaller in size, with slender necks and a length ranging from two to four feet on average. These snakes feature pale-colored bellies with black, gray, or brown mottled colors. Its scales lay upside down, and its eyes flash vertical slits for pupils, similar to a cat’s in appearance. The eyes can be orange, red, or tan. Young snakes are usually grayer than their adult counterparts, sporting yellow or green tails that eventually darken into bronzer hues. Its lighter-colored tail serves as a lure for prey, helping the young snake attract animals who mistake its tail for a worm or insect food. These snakes aren’t as dangerous as others in the pit viper family for a variety of reasons. Agkistrodon contortrix aren’t nearly as aggressive as other snakes, and their venom isn’t as potent. Eastern copperhead venom is a hemotoxin, meaning it attacks red blood cells. Researchers estimate it would take approximately 100 milligrams of venom to kill a human; very few people have died from an eastern copperhead bite. That said, their venom still requires medical attention. Additionally, Agkistrodon contortrix will deliver dry bites to warn off would-be attackers. These bites contain little to no venom and often occur when a snake is stepped on or otherwise agitated. When venom is mixed into the bite, symptoms include severe pain, nausea, swelling of the bite site, and tingling sensations. Copperhead bites can injure muscles or bones, especially in a hand or foot if that’s where they occur. Interestingly, researchers discovered that eastern copperhead venom contains a protein called “contortrostatin” with evidence indicating that it halts cancer cell growth in mice. The protein was also shown to inhibit the movement of cancerous cells in the body, keeping tumors in one spot instead of spreading. Despite this promising evidence, further clinical research is required to verify results and effectiveness. Eastern copperheads are described more often as shy than aggressive. They are diurnal in the spring and fall but become nocturnal during the hotter summer months. These snakes hibernate during the winter, but if the weather’s warm enough, they may choose to leave their den to sun themselves. Agkistrodon contortrix are unique when they encounter danger in that they freeze in place rather than escape or attack the threat. Copperheads rely on the camouflage of fallen leaves or similar-colored dirt to hide them from predators and usually find success. When predators get too close, they’ll vibrate their tale and create a noise similar to that of rattlesnakes. When hunting, Agkistrodon contortrix will still and wait for prey to walk within biting distance. They use their venom to paralyze their prey or simply hold it in their mouths if the food is small enough. Copperheads will swallow their food whole, with a diet ranging from various insects like spiders and grasshoppers to frogs, lizards, small rodents, and rabbits. Occasionally, these pit vipers will feed on carrion. Pregnant females, conversely, fast or consume small amounts of food until they reproduce. Breeding season occurs in late summer. Males seek a mate by flicking their tongs and sensing female pheromones, and they sometimes will fight over the attention of a female. Females can mate with many males and produce a litter with several different fathers. Interestingly, females may not become gravid immediately, storing sperm until after hibernation to begin the gestation period, usually 80 to 150 days. Females can breed between every one to three years. Agkistrodon contortrix do not nest; instead, they give birth in crevices in rocky cliffsides or rock formations called a rookery. Copperheads give birth to live young in a litter that averages four to seven new snakes, though litters of up to 21 young snakes have occurred. Following delivery, the mother will stay with the babies for a few days before they venture out into the world. Young snakes are ready for mating at about 3.5 years of age and can live as long as 29 years."

    "Name": "White Eyed Vireo",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects",
    "Text": "Vireo griseus, or the white-eyed vireo, are small birds belonging to the Vireonidae family and Passeriformes order. This family contains 60 species of birds! They derived their name because of their white eyes and inhabit several states in North America like Missouri, New Jersey, Florida, and Texas. In addition, they occur in the Bahamas and Cuba. White-eyed vireos like habitats with dense shrubs and bushes, preferably in an abandoned field. In addition, they are a year-round resident in many countries across South America. They have a greenish tinge that blends in well with their surroundings, providing them with the essential camouflage they need. Their mating season begins in April and lasts till August. These birds are monogamous, and both genders build nests and incubate the eggs. Once the eggs hatch, males and females feed the young for several days. Their plumage is yellowish-gray, and they have yellow sides with white bellies. In addition, they have a black beak and legs. Their song consists of six to seven short phrase calls, generally used by the male to attract a mate during the breeding season. However, chicks also use this call. White-eyed vireos are native to North America and Central America . They are Neotropical migrants that participate in seasonal migrations multiple times a year. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . However, they inhabit the southeastern United States and Northern Mexico during mating season. This distribution occurs over states like: These birds are year-round residents along the southeast coastline of the USA from Texas to South Carolina and Mexico. However, during the colder months, most populations will migrate to Belize, Mexico, Cuba, Guatemala, the Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas. They like to inhabit dense, brushy vegetation close to a water source. In order to defend their nesting territory, white-eyed vireo males sing incessantly from early spring to late summer. During courtship, males put on exciting displays by fluffing their plumage, spreading their tails, and letting out a whining call. Then, both genders help to build the nest, which they construct low to the ground in a shrub or sapling. They will weave the rim onto a horizontal forked twig to ensure the nest is secure. The nest is deep and hangs in the shape of a cup. White-eyed vireos make their nest from roots, shreds of bark, twigs, grass stems, leaves, plant down, moss, lichen, and sometimes pieces of wasp nests. They construct their nests with spiderwebs, which help bind them and line them with fine grass, feathers, and fibers. The white-eyed vireo’s scientific name is Vireo griseus, and they belong to the order Passeriformes . The members of this order make up more than half of the entire bird species! Their most distinguishable feature is the arrangement of their toes, with three pointing forwards and one pointing back, this aids with perching. White-eyed vireos are members of the Vireonidae family, which consists of 43 species of small arboreal songbirds, divided between four genera. The relationships of this family with other bird families are not entirely clear, but evidence suggests that they are closely related to the New World warblers. The family Vireonidae is divided into three subfamilies: White-eyed vireos are small birds that measure 5 inches in length and have a wingspan of around 7.4 inches. In addition, adults weigh approximately 0.40 ounces. Their sides are dark olive, and they have black wings and tails. Each wing sports two white wing bars with white or yellow margins on the primaries. Their heads are olive, and they possess a gray nape. However, their most distinctive feature is their illuminating yellow spectacles, which include the area between and around the eyes. Another identifying feature is their white irises, only visible in adults. In addition, they have white bellies and throats and dull yellow sides. Their legs and beaks are a dark black color. Juveniles have dark black irises that only change color when they reach 2 years old. Juveniles differ from adults in more than one way; instead of yellow spectacles, they have white, and their heads are pale gray. In addition, their plumage is paler in comparison to their parents. However, unlike most bird species, both genders look similar. During the mating season, white-eyed vireos spread throughout eastern Texas and travel as far north as southeastern Iowa and Illinois. In addition, they expand as far as southern Ontario, Maryland, and Connecticut in the east. However, in the winter months, white-eyed vireos occupy southern territories in Mexico, and Central America , as far as Honduras. Other winter locations include Bermuda, the Caribbean, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Sometimes these birds get lost while migrating and land up much further west or north than they typically expected. White-eyed vireos are typically solitary but sometimes live in pairs. During their fall migration, it is common for these birds to join mixed foraging flocks containing other species. In order to stay well-hidden, they tend to inhabit lower thickets, which makes it difficult to see their coloration properly. However, their white eyes and yellow spectacles stick out and act as good field marks, even when visuals are obscured. These birds prey primarily on insects and enjoy a range of insects, including spiders and larvae. Sometimes, if there is a food shortage, white-eyed vireos also eat snails and small lizards . In addition, they feed on berries and other fruits. White-eyed vireos are monogamous, and females will visit the males’ territories to choose a mate. The males don’t participate in any sensational courtship displays. However, the pair will court each other for several days, where they will forage together. While these birds are monogamous, they do not mate for life. Surprisingly, they only stay together for one season. The mating season ranges from early April to August, and after pairing up, both genders search for a nesting site. They build their nest off the ground, usually around 3 feet from the surface. Females seek out a comfortable nesting site with a forked branch for support. White-eyed vireos build their nests in a cup shape and construct them with grass, spider silk, twigs, and bark strips. It takes the pair around 3 to 5 days to build the nest and once done, the female lays 3 to 5 white eggs with dark spots. Then, the male and female white-eyed vireos incubate the eggs for around 13 to 15 days. Once hatched, the juveniles leave the nest within 9 to 11 days. However, before they go, both parents share the responsibility of caring for them. As a result, fledglings sometimes depend on their parents for 23 days after leaving the nest. Chicks hatch blind and naked with a few down patches here and there. White-eyed vireos have a unique characteristic; parents develop a brood patch on their bellies, providing the eggs with extra warmth. White-eyed vireos have an average lifespan of 10 years. The predators that prey on white-eyed vireos have rarely been documented, as most predation occurs during the mating season when eggs and hatchlings are abundant. However, it is likely these birds fall prey to : The white-eyed vireo’s numbers are increasing year by year because of their large geographical range and population size, and they are listed as Least Concern on IUCN’s Redlist. However, their numbers could start decreasing because of habitat loss and extensive human activity in their natural habitats. The white-eyed vireo population is increasing, and their population size is estimated at 24 million individuals. There are approximately 60 species of vireos in the world, and while they have similar characteristics, these species differ in some way, shape, or form. Below are four of the most popular species. The yellow-throated vireo is native to parts of eastern North America . They are the most vivacious of the vireo family with their bright yellow and olive-gray plumage. These birds migrate south during winter, primarily to Central America and northern South America. They can become fiercly territorial during winter, especially with members of the same species. They prefer to inhabit deciduous forests and endure human presence. In addition, they can be found in habitats like beaches, shrubs, plantations, and cypress swamps. Yellow-throated vireos are foragers and often fly with mixed flocks, especially when migrating. They let out harsh and scolding calls, and their songs are broken and burry-like. They are very protective of their nests, which are usually built high in trees. Currently, their population is These birds have one of the most purest chirps forming songs that vibrate in the atmosphere. Bell’s vireos are native to North and Central America. Bell’s vireos are small neotropical migratory birds that grow to lengths of 4.5 to 4.9 inches and weigh between 0.2 to 0.3 ounces. They primarily feed on ground and aerial insects . Bell’s vireos have olive-yellow plumage with a tinge of gray. However, their subspecies, the least Bell’s vireo, is mostly gray. Their beaks and legs are dark brown, and they have medium-sized tails. In addition, these birds have a wingspan of 6.7 to 7.5 inches. Bell’s vireos are not endangered and are listed as Least Concern on IUCN’s redlist. Thick-billed vireos are medium-sized birds, approximately 5.5 inches in length. They have greyish olive heads and backs, pale yellow or buffy white underparts, and their undertails are shaded white. In addition, their wings and tails are dark, and they have two white wing bars on each wing. Thick-billed vireos have dark irises, unlike their cousins, the white-eyed vireo, and their bills are large and gray. Lastly, both sexes look alike. Breeding males occur in southeastern Florida and the Florida Keys. In addition, they are common in the Caribbean, where their preferred habitats include dense undergrowth and thickets. The blue-headed vireo has a pleasing palette of bluish gray, moss green, and greenish-yellow, which is complimented by their bold white spectacles, throat, and belly. In addition, they have sharp black wings and tails Like their cousins, the blue-headed vireo forages for larvae and insects in trees, moving swiftly through branches inaccessible by most other bird species. Males below out a slow and happy chorale, which is the first thing to listen for when searching for one. During the warmer months, Blue-headed vireos forage in the canopy of mature forests. They are often heard singing, which helps them distinguish their calls from Philadelphia, yellow-throated, and red-eyed vireos."

    "Name": "Largemouth Bass",
    "Diet": "Carnivore that eats small shrimp, bait fish, water fleas, insects, microscopic crustaceans, crustaceans, frogs, bats, worms, snakes, crawfish, younger offspring of larger fish, salamanders, small birds, mammals, and turtle and alligator hatchlings",
    "Origin": "Southeastern Canada, Eastern United States, Northeastern Mexico",
    "Text": "Largemouth bass do have large mouths: they use them as “vacuum cleaners,” creating suction when they open them to devour their preys! The largemouth bass , a member of the black bass ( Micropterus ) genus, is a popular carnivorous freshwater fish native to North America . However, it has spread as an invasive species throughout the world. Largemouth bass are not a big part of commercial fishing, as their meat is mushy and not that good. They are a very popular catch among game fishermen, though, because of their challenging aggressive behavior. Largemouth bass are game fish from the Micropterus genus, commonly known as “black bass.” This genus is part of the Centrarchidae , or sunfish , family. The scientific name of the largemouth bass is Micropterus salmoides. There are two sub-species, the Florida largemouth bass ( Micropterus s. floridanus ) and the Northern largemouth bass ( Micropterus s. salmoides ), which is slightly smaller than its Florida counterpart. The largemouth bass has an elongated appearance. It can be a combination of gray, green, or light brown if it is in darker water. The top of the fish has an olive-colored camouflage pattern, while its side has a broad, broken pattern black stripe with green-tinged black spots on its scales. The rounded tail or caudal fin can have a black-tinged edge, especially in younger fish. Its large mouth has a long upper jaw that reaches behind the eye and a rough line of teeth on both the top and the bottom jaws. It has ten hard dorsal spines in a concave configuration, 11-14 soft dorsal rays, a pair of pelvic fins, and an anal fin with three spines and 10-12 rays. The female is larger than the male. Native to Eastern North America, including Canada , the United States , and Northern Mexico , the original distribution of M. salmoides was within the river basins of the Mississippi , St. Lawrence ( Great Lakes ), and Red River (Hudson Bay). They also live in Atlantic Slope drainages (from North Carolina to Florida) and Gulf Coast drainages (from Southern Florida to Northern Mexico.) Largemouth bass have been introduced worldwide in Europe , Asia , and Africa , where they have damaged various habitats and are considered an invasive species. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The IUCN has listed the status of the largemouth bass as of “least concern.” There is a large species population worldwide, and considering the generational trends over the last ten years, it is considered stable. Largemouth bass thrive in warm, freshwater bodies of water. They like to live by shallow vegetation-covered shorelines where there are a variety of submerged shelters, such as rocks and logs. Since they hunt by sight, they prefer clear waters where they can see well, rather than murky or cloudy bodies of water. They will eat any prey that can fit in their mouths, severely impacting other fish populations. In order to nest, males require a floor with a soft or impressionable composition where they can carve out a space for eggs with their tails. Although they are efficient predators themselves, several other fish, such as northern pike , larger bass, crappie , walleye , yellow perch , carp , channel catfish , eels , and muskellunge, as well as shore birds, such as herons , kingfishers , and bitterns prey upon young largemouth bass. The bald eagle even preys upon adult bass. Apart from these, the chief predators of the largemouth bass are humans . As previously mentioned, largemouth bass will eat almost any prey that will fit into their mouths that they use as “vacuum cleaners.” That means that younger bass will limit themselves to smaller prey, like small shrimp , bait fish, water fleas, insects , and microscopic crustaceans . Adult bass eat small fish, crustaceans, frogs , bats , worms , snakes , crawfish , younger offspring of larger fish, and salamanders . They will even eat small birds , mammals , and turtle and alligator hatchlings. They can move to deeper waters in larger lakes to pursue their prey. Largemouth bass are polyandrous. That means that the male mates once, while the female mates multiple times after they reach about one year of age. Largemouth bass mate in the late winter or early spring from March to July, depending on the latitude and the temperature of the water, which needs to be at least a consistent 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The male uses its tail to dig a nest in the bottom of the water body while the female waits in deeper water. Once the nest is complete, the male guides the female over the nest and keeps it there by swimming circles around it. It then prods the female to release its eggs, releasing sperm that mixes with the eggs as they settle into the nest. The male will guard the nest until the eggs hatch in a few days, after which it will guard the fries until they are ready to leave the nest, which will be about 10 days to two weeks. During that time, the male may eat a number of fries as he gets hungry. After a couple of weeks, the parents and the young fish will begin to focus on feeding. In the wild, largemouth bass live from 15 to 23 years. They live from eight to 12 years in captivity. Angling enthusiasts prize largemouth bass due to their fighting nature. They will struggle against the line once hooked, including jumping out of the water to free themselves. Anglers will use a variety of lures and some forms of live bait, such as worms or minnows, to coax bass out of the shallow cover of vegetation, logs, or overhangs. It is popular among sportsmen to use the catch-and-release method to fish, especially releasing larger fish, as they tend to be females and contribute to the stock. As long as the hook is not too deep or swallowed, largemouth bass have a high survival rate after being hooked and released. The meat of the largemouth bass tends to be white and tender, with few bones in the fillets. The taste is mild and slightly fishy . Removal of the skin and the bloodline can improve the taste, reducing fishiness. People tend to immediately like or dislike it, with more people preferring the flavor of smallmouth bass. The FDA can’t control the quality of the fish since it’s fished from so many streams across the country. That is wild largemouth bass are typically unavailable in restaurants. Higher-quality meat can be found on younger bass measuring under 12 inches. Commercial farming of the fish is not widespread, though demand is increasing in Asian markets."

    "Name": "Black Capped Chickadee",
    "Text": "The Black-Capped Chickadee is a popular and easily recognizable North American songbird. These birds travel together in small flocks, using their calls to signal where food can be found, the presence of danger, and “all clear” signals. Many other small songbirds, such as warblers , nuthatches , and titmice, travel with chickadees in order to benefit from their vigilance and warnings. Chickadees are considered to be friendly birds, getting along well with other small songbirds and showing little fear of humans. Black-Capped Chickadees are native to North America . Their range stretches north to Alaska and Canada, south to New Mexico , west to California , and east to New York . Since Black-Capped Chickadees do not migrate, they can be observed in these areas during winter, spring, summer, and fall. The best place to view these birds is at a backyard bird feeder. They can also be seen flitting between tree branches or shrubbery. Black-Capped Chickadees nest in tree hollows or birdhouses with small openings, located 1 to 10 feet off the ground. They build the cup-shaped nest from loosely woven feathers, moss, grasses, and other plant fibers. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The Black-capped Chickadee is classified under the Latin name Parus atricapillus in most reference guides. This name was given in 1760. Occasionally, the alternate scientific name Poecile atricapillus appears, assigning the bird to a different genus. This alteration in relationships to other, similar birds has been proposed due to DNA research. Either way, it is recognized by the shortened form P. atricapillus. It belongs to the class Aves (birds), the order Passeriformes, and the family Paridae. The Black-Capped Chickadee is a small bird, weighing less than half an ounce. It is less than 6 inches in length and has a wingspan of 6 to 8 inches. The Black-Capped Chickadee is named for its striking color pattern. It has a black head and neck, with white patches on the sides of the face. Its back, wings, and tail are gray with black and white markings. Its belly is white with reddish-brown patches near the wings. Males and females display the same markings. Black-Capped Chickadees are social birds, often seen in male/female pairs or small flocks of up to 12 individuals. They may travel with small birds of other species as well. Chickadees are highly communicative. While foraging together, they concentrate their efforts in locations where one flock member has found success. They also look out for dangers, such as predators. When a potential threat is spotted, the bird utters a warning call. Its companions freeze and imitate the call, which may confuse the predator. When the danger has passed, the birds utter an “all clear” call. Chickadees do not migrate. Black-capped chickadees forage in small groups for insects , insect eggs and larvae, berries, and seeds. They frequent manmade seed feeders as well. Hawks , owls , and cats are common hunters of chickadees. Snakes and raccoons may eat chickadee eggs. The biggest threats to chickadees come from people. We use pesticides that may poison them through biomagnification. We have taken their habitat and built cities on it. It is estimated that the United States can only support large songbird populations because so many people maintain seed feeders. The Black-Capped Chickadee is not an endangered species. It is listed as an animal of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Red List of Threatened Species. Black-Capped Chickadees lay 5 to 10 eggs each spring. The eggs hatch after 11 to 13 days of incubation. The young birds molt in less than 2 weeks and leave the nest 14 to 18 days after hatching. In the wild, chickadees usually live less than 3 years. The oldest known chickadee was a male who lived 11.5 years. The Black-Capped Chickadee population is estimated at 41 million individuals, with regional population increases over the past few years.",

    "Name": "Eastern Turkey Wild Turkey",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats acorns, nuts, seeds, berries, and insects",
    "Text": "“ Males have large featherless, reddish heads, necks, and wattles, with fleshy growths called caruncles. ” The eastern turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) is a large upland ground bird native to North America. It inhabits hardwood forests with scattered clearings where it spends time foraging low to the ground or roosting in flocks in tall trees. These wild birds are loud and vocal, expressing themselves with various noises. Discover all there is to know about this magnificent North American bird, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. The eastern turkey lives in North America in three countries: Canada , the United States, and Mexico. The eastern subspecies inhabits the entire eastern half of the United States from Maine to Northern Florida and as far west as Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri. Its Canadian range extends into Southeastern Ontario and Southwestern Quebec. They live in hardwood forests with scattered openings like pastures, fields, orchards, and seasonal marshes. They prefer oak-hickory, red oak, beech, cherry, and white ash in the Northeast. Look for them foraging on the ground or walking along small bushes and trees, and listen for their many vocalizations. Females search for nest sites, which are shallow dirt depressions surrounded by woody vegetation. They typically place their eggs on a pile of twigs and sticks. The eastern turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo silvestris ) is a subspecies of wild turkey from the Galliformes order, which includes heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds like turkeys, chickens , and quail. The Phasianidae family has many of the most popular game fowl. Meleagris is the turkey genus, encompassing North America’s wild turkey and Mexico’s ocellated turkey. There are six recognized subspecies of wild turkey: Eastern, Osceola, Rio Grande , Merriam’s, Gould’s, and South Mexican. Eastern turkeys are large upland ground birds, measuring 30 to 49 inches long and weighing 5.5 to 24 pounds, with a 4.1 to 4.9-foot wingspan. Females are much smaller than males, weighing eight pounds less on average. Adults have black or gray-brown feathers with a coppery sheen. Males have large featherless, reddish heads, necks, and wattles, with fleshy growths called caruncles. These parts, along with the snood (fleshly flap on the bill), become engorged when excited. They have long fan-shaped tails, and their feathers have bronze, gold, red, purple, and iridescent areas. Females have duller feathers in shades of brown and gray. Wild turkeys are loud, vocal birds who express themselves with many sounds, from gobbles, yelps, clucks, purrs, low-pitched drumming, and “spits” (sharp expulsions of air from the air sac). Their gobbles can be heard from a mile away! Despite their significant size, they are fast, agile fliers. You may see them flying under the canopy, searching for a perch, or gliding low to the ground. These birds are relatively social, roosting in flocks and foraging with other animals like deer and squirrels . Eastern turkeys are nonmigratory. They may move to areas with larger trees and closed canopies for increased warmth during the fall and winter. The eastern turkey is an omnivore who forages in the early morning and late afternoon. These wild turkeys eat acorns and nuts from various trees like hazel, chestnut, hickory, and pine. They also consume seeds, berries, buds, leaves, roots, grasses, and insects . And will occasionally eat amphibians, salamanders, snakes, and lizards . They forage on the ground or in low bushes and small trees. You can often find them feeding in cow pastures or visiting backyard feeders. The IUCN lists the eastern turkey as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and large, increasing population, this species does not meet the “threatened” status thresholds. They do not face any severe threats currently. But they may suffer from the future effects of climate change and urbanization. The eastern turkey is the most heavily hunted subspecies of wild turkey. Wild turkey eggs and nestlings are vulnerable to raccoons , opossums, skunks, foxes, groundhogs, and snakes. Poults (poultry young) can be attacked by raptors, such as owls, hawks, and bald eagles . Adult eastern turkey predators include great horned owls, northern goshawks, domestic dogs , cats, coyotes, wolves, bobcats, golden eagles, and alligators. Wild turkeys and their young often run away when threatened, but they may lash out aggressively when cornered. They can kick with their legs and use their bony spurs as weapons. They may also bite with their beaks and ram with their bodies as a last effort. Male eastern turkeys are polygamous and mate with as many hens as possible. They perform their courtship rituals during March and April while they are still flocked for winter. Males strut, gobble, boom, drum, and spit to show dominance and attract mates. Hens lay 10 to 14 whitish eggs and incubate them for 28 days. Their young, or poults, fledge the nest 12 to 24 hours after hatching. However, they stay with their mother for around four months. Males, or “toms,” become sexually mature at seven months old, and hens around one to two years. Their average lifespan is seven years, but they can survive up to 13. The global eastern turkey population is unknown, but their numbers have significantly increased in North America over the last 40 years. They are also not experiencing extreme fluctuations or fragmentations in their populations. Sources:"

    "Name": "Common Grackle",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, small fish, rodents, frogs, lizards, and eggs",
    "Text": "“T heir wintering flocks can grow to over one million individuals. ” The common grackle ( Quiscalus quiscula) is a large blackbird native to North America , where it lives as a resident or short-term migrant in Canada, the United States , and Mexico. This species inhabits open country areas like groves, farmlands, and woodland edges. These gregarious birds are highly social and loud, chattering to one another as they perch atop trees and power lines. Discover all there is to know about the common grackle, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. Common grackles live in North America in five countries, including Canada , the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. This bird is a permanent resident in most of its range, but the northern populations migrate to the southern US during winter. These grackles prefer open to semi-open country areas, such as farmlands, groves, woodland edges, marshes, agricultural fields, suburbs, pastures, and towns. Look for them in large mixed-species flocks, foraging on the ground or in shallow water. You may hear these raucous birds before you see them. Grackles nest in communities from 10 pairs up to 100 or more. They nest in areas with dense trees near open spaces, such as parks , woodlands edges, and groves. Females build a bulky open cup nest made with twigs, mud, and grass, lined with fine grass. She hides it in vegetation near water, around 20 feet above the ground. The common grackle ( Quiscalus quiscula) is from the Passeriformes order in the Icteridae family, encompassing New World blackbirds. The Quiscalus genus contains seven of the eleven grackle species. The common grackle has three recognized subspecies: the purple, Florida, and bronzed grackles. The common grackle is a New World blackbird, measuring 11 to 13 inches and weighing 2.6 to 5 ounces, with a 14 to 18-inch wingspan. They have long bills, long tails, bright golden eyes, and flat heads. Adults have glossy purple heads, and their bodies are a bronze sheen. Females are smaller, have shorter tails, and are less iridescent in color. Juveniles are browner with dark eyes. Grackles are highly social, congregating in large flocks to nest, forage, and fly. They may nest with other bird species, and their wintering flocks can grow to over one million individuals. These birds are also known for being loud, often clucking, screeching, and chattering with each other as they sit atop trees and power lines. These blackbirds are known to be bullies as they push other species out of the way while feeding at bird feeders. Outside their courtship aerial displays, grackles fly in a straight path with stiff wingbeats, reaching speeds up to 39 Mph. The common grackle is a resident to short-term migrant in its range. They live year-round in the southeastern half of the United States. But populations that breed in the Northern US and Canada migrate to the Central and Southern US during the winter, occasionally reaching Mexico and the Bahamas. Common grackles are omnivores who forage on the ground or in shallow water. They primarily eat insects but will also consume small fish , rodents, frogs, lizards, eggs, and young of other birds. Their insect diet includes beetles , grasshoppers, caterpillars, spiders, millipedes, and worms. They supplement their diet in winter with berries, seeds, grains, and acorns. The common grackle forages on the ground, in shallow water, or shrubs and trees. They feed in flocks and occasionally steal food and eggs from other birds. You may also see this species at backyard feeders. The IUCN lists the common grackle as NC or “near threatened.” This species is undergoing a continuous decline in its population. However, the reduction seems to be slowing, and their population is more extensive than previously suspected, so the status is precautionarily listed as near threatened . The common grackle is a significant pest species due to its propensity for damaging grains, seeds, and fruit. It also spreads the fatal human respiratory disease histoplasmosis. Consequently, this grackle is the subject of population control and other deterrent measures. Grackle predators include domestic cats , raccoons, hawks, and owls. Squirrels and snakes are their primary nest predators who steal and eat their eggs and young. Males stand guard at their nests, and both sexes actively defend their site by mobbing, chasing, or diving at intruders. Common grackles are typically monogamous and form breeding pairs in the spring. Courtship involves singing, posturing, and flight displays. Females lay an average of four to five pale blue eggs with brown blotches. Only the females incubate the eggs for 12 to 14 days, but both parents feed the nestlings (mainly insects). The young fledge the nest 16 to 20 days after hatching and reach sexual maturity around one year. They have an average lifespan of 5.6 years but can live up to 23 years in the wild. The common grackle global population is estimated to number 69 million mature individuals. Despite its significant population, this species has undergone over a 60% decrease in North America over the last 40 years. However, researchers do not suspect future declines in this bird. Its primary reason for the decline is due to population control efforts."

    "Name": "White Crowned Sparrow",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats seeds, vegetation, and insects",
    "Text": "“They have different song dialects and prefer to sing the one they grew up with.” The white-crowned sparrow ( Zonotrichia leucophrys) is a medium-sized New World sparrow native to North America. It inhabits alpine meadows and tundra in Alaska and Northern Canada but chooses to stay in thickets and backyards in its US and Mexico wintering homes. These birds have interesting songs, can fly long distances, and have social personalities. Discover everything there is to know about the white-crowned sparrow! The white-crowned sparrow lives in at least five countries in North America, including Canada , the United States , Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Some populations are year-round residents in their Pacific Coast homes in the US, while those who breed in Alaska and Northern Canada migrate south to the United States and Mexico. They inhabit open spaces like tundra, alpine meadows, and forest edges during breeding. In the winter, you can find them in thickets, backyards, and agricultural fields. Look for them hopping about on the ground or tree branches, often in flocks during the winter. And listen for their sweet whistles. The nest is placed on the ground in a shallow depression near the base of shrubs or grass in the northern regions. Populations further south tend to put theirs in shrubs a few feet off the ground. Females build the nest by forming an open cup made of grass, twigs, weeds, and bark. They line the inside with soft grass, feathers, and animal hair. The white-crowned sparrow ( Zonotrichia leucophrys ) is from the Passerellidae family, a group of New World passerine birds. Its genus, Zonotrichia, contains five American sparrows, four of which are in North America . Zonotrichia is Ancient Greek for “band” and “hair,” and Leucophrys means “white” and “eyebrow.” There are five recognized subspecies of white-crowned sparrows. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The white-crowned sparrow is a medium-sized New World sparrow featuring a small bill and a long tail. They measure 5.9 to 6.3 inches long and weigh 0.9 to one ounce, with an 8.3 to 9.4-inch wingspan. Their wings and upper body parts are brown and heavily streaked, while their undersides are gray. They have black and white stripes on their heads, gray faces, and pink or yellow bills. These sparrows spend their days hopping around on branches or the ground near bushes and trees. They are relatively social, forming pairs during the breeding season and foraging in flocks in winter. They are strong fliers that can travel 300 miles in one night! Their songs are thin, sweet whistles followed by buzzy notes. Males learn distinct songs from the community they grew up in and continue to sing in the same dialect as adults. Some males can be bilingual, singing in two dialects. White-crowned sparrows are residents or medium-distance migrants. Those that breed in Alaska and Northern Canada migrate to most of the US and Mexico during winter. Populations along the US Pacific Coast and the interior west stay year-round in their environments. White-crowned sparrows are omnivores who forage in flocks. They primarily eat seeds, vegetation, and insects. This sparrow mainly eats weed and grass seeds during the winter and insects and spiders in the summer. Throughout most seasons, they feed on buds, moss, flowers, berries, and small pieces of fruit. They forage in flocks outside the nesting season and find their food by hopping and running on the ground. Occasionally, you will find them in low-lying shrubs or mid-air as they jump out to catch flying insects. The IUCN lists the white-crowned sparrow as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and extremely large and stable population, this species does not meet the thresholds for “threatened” status. While nothing immediate threatens their population, the white-crowned sparrow could suffer the effects of climate change in the future. They are highly susceptible to habitat loss from wildfires and endangered young from spring heat waves. Their primary predators include large birds like crows , jays, owls, and hawks. Snakes are also known to steal eggs from their nest. These sparrows are naturally alert birds who rely on camouflage and their flying ability to defend themselves most of the time. Males are typically more aggressive towards different bird species than their own. They may fly towards intruders with their crown feathers erect and chest puffed out while singing loudly. White-crowned sparrows are monogamous during the breeding season, and some may partner with the same mate during the following season. Females lay between two and six (four to five on average) pale green eggs with reddish brown spots. Females incubate by themselves for 11 to 14 days, and both parents assist in feeding the nestlings (mainly insects). The young fledge the nest seven to twelve days after hatching, but the males continue to care for them while the females begin their second nesting attempt. Populations in the northern regions typically only lay one breed per year, but those further south can have up to four. These sparrows are sexually mature by one-year-old. They have an average lifespan of 2.6 years in the wild but can live up to 13. The global white-crowned sparrow population is estimated to number 79 million mature individuals. From 1970 to 2017, their population underwent a slight decline of 0.3% per year. However, their numbers have been considered stable for the last ten years, with no extreme fluctuations or fragmentations."

    "Name": "Gray Catbird",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats fruit and insects, such as berries, cherries, grasshoppers, and beetles",
    "Text": "“ Listen for their mechanical, raspy mimicry as they hide in bushes and trees. ” The gray catbird ( Dumetella carolinensis) is a medium-sized songbird native to North America. It inhabits dense vegetative areas like overgrown farmland and abandoned orchards, where it prefers to hide in thorny thickets and sing its songs of mimicry. Look for this species low to the ground as it forages for insects and berries. Learn everything there is to know about this catbird, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. The gray catbird lives in North America in over 20 countries, including Canada , the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico , and Jamaica. This species is migratory, breeding in the temperate United States and Canada and wintering in the Southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America , and the Caribbean. They are also extremely rare vagrants to Western Europe . Catbirds inhabit dense vegetative substrates, such as scrublands, woodland edges, overgrown farmland, and abandoned orchards. During the winter, they live in thickets near a water source with plenty of berries. Look for them low to the ground as they hop along thick vegetation, and listen for their mechanical, raspy mimicry as they hide in bushes and trees. They place the nest three to ten feet above the ground in dense shrubs, thickets, and briar tangles. Females build a large bulky cup using twigs, leaves, grass, weeds, and trash and line the inside with finer material. The gray catbird ( Dumetella carolinensis) is from the Mimidae family, which consists of New World catbirds, thrashers, mockingbirds, and tremblers. This family is known for its vocalizations and ability to mimic many species. Its genus, Dumetella, is Latin for “thorny thicket” and refers to the bird’s propensity for singing in hidden undergrowth. Its specific name, Carolinensis, is New Latin for “from the Carolinas.” The gray catbird is monotypic, meaning it has no recognized subspecies. The gray catbird is a medium-sized passerine bird, measuring 8.1 to 9.4 inches long and weighing 0.8 to 2.0 ounces, with an 8.7 to 11.8-inch wingspan. They have long, rounded tails, straight, narrow bills, long legs, and broad wings. They are a lead-gray color all over, but the top of the head, tail, and wing remiges are a darker gray to black. Males and females are indistinguishable, but juveniles are plainer with buffy undertails. Named for its cat-like call, the gray catbird can mimic other birds and animals, like tree frogs . Its voice has a raspy mechanical quality. It has a songbird syrinx and can make two sounds at once. You won’t find them singing their songs while sitting perched on a branch. Instead, they prefer to hide inside bushes as they sing. They spend their days hopping through low vegetation and flying short distances. These birds are rather aggressive and territorial, even during winter. They often run off intruders and will even destroy the eggs and nestlings of other woodland bird species. Gray catbirds breed throughout most of the United States, except for the West Coast. They migrate to the Gulf Coast during winter, from Florida to Texas, down to Central America and the Caribbean. Populations along the US East Coast are nonmigratory and remain in their environments year-round. Gray catbirds are omnivores, and half of their diet consists of fruit and berries. They eat fruit such as holly berries, cherries, blackberries, and elderberries. In the summer, they rely more on insects, like grasshoppers , ants, beetles, worms, and other bugs. It forages for berries in shrubs and trees and looks for insects on the ground by flipping leaves aside. The IUCN lists the gray catbird as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and large, stable population, this species does not meet the “threatened” status thresholds. While this species does not face any imminent threats, it may be susceptible to the future effects of urbanization and climate change. Spring heat waves can endanger the young in their nests, and wildfires can destroy their habitats. Their predators include snakes, rats , cats, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, blue jays, crows, and grackles. These animals mainly prey on catbird eggs and chicks but are not always successful. Gray catbird parents hide their nests in extremely dense shrubbery to prevent nest predation. Their gray plumage also acts as a camouflage as they move in the shadows of tangles. This species is not afraid of predators and flash its wings and tails while making its “mew” sounds. Gray catbirds form monogamous pair bonds during breeding, and courtship involves singing, chasing, posturing, and bowing. Pairs produce two broods per season. Females lay an average of four (but can be anywhere from two to six) greenish-blue eggs. Females incubate alone for 12 to 13 days, but both parents assist in feeding the nestlings. The young fledge the nest 10 to 11 days after hatching. This species becomes sexually mature around one year old and lives an average of 6.3 years. The global gray catbird population is 29 million mature individuals, and their trends have been stable for the last 40 years in North America . They are also not experiencing any extreme fluctuations or fragmentations in their numbers."

    "Name": "Blue Racer",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, rodents, small birds, frogs, snakes",
    "Text": "A blue racer snake can move at a speed of 4.3 mph. It’s hard to overlook the beautiful, electric blue scales of a blue racer snake. On top of that, this snake has great speed moving at over four miles an hour! It lives in North America, specifically in the northeastern portion of the United States. Blue racers are not poisonous and grow to a length of 60 inches (sometimes longer). Their habitat includes open meadows, prairies, and pond shorelines. The blue racer (Coluber constrictor foxii) is a species of non-venomous snake native to North America, particularly the Great Lakes region and parts of the Midwest. It is a member of the Colubridae family, which is the largest family of snakes. The origins of the blue racer can be traced back to the evolution of its ancestor, the Coluber constrictor, which dates back to the Miocene epoch, around 20 million years ago. Over time, different subspecies of Coluber constrictor emerged, including the blue racer subspecies, Coluber constrictor foxii. The blue racer is believed to have evolved its distinctive blue coloration as a form of camouflage, allowing it to blend in with the blue sky when viewed from above. This coloration also helps to protect the snake from predators by making it appear larger and more intimidating. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The blue racer snake lives in North America. In the United States, its range extends over several northeastern states including Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. This snake is also known as an eastern racer . In addition, the blue racer is found on the eastern portion of Pelee Island in Ontario, Canada. However, they are considered endangered there. These snakes are most commonly seen in open areas such as grassy meadows and on prairies. Their preferred habitat gives them places to hide from predators and hunt for prey. They are not as visible during the cold weather months when they go into brumation in a den or burrow with other snakes. Blue racers emerge in March or April for their breeding season. Countries where these snakes are found: The blue racer snake is one of many subspecies of eastern racer snakes in the Colubridae family. Coluber constrictor foxii is the long scientific name for a long snake! The Latin word Coluber means snake and the word constrictor means drawn together. This refers to the snake’s method of killing its prey by constriction. The Latin word foxii is a tribute to 19th-century wildlife collector and naturalist, Reverend Charles Fox. The blue racer is also called an eastern racer because of its territory. Its family is Colubridae and class Reptilia. The blue racer snake is considered endangered in Canada due to the loss of its habitat and food source. Plus, it’s classified in Wisconsin as a species of special concern. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species doesn’t have specific population information on the blue racer snake. But it reports the eastern racer snake population as a whole is stable and estimated at over 1,000,000. It’s thought of as Least Concern . The blue racer has smooth scales on its back that are solid electric blue or grayish in color. Its belly is white, or cream and it sometimes has a yellow throat. The slender head of this snake matches the width of the rest of its body. It can be 35 to 60 inches in length as a full-grown snake. Take a close look at the face of a blue racer and you’ll see black scales around its circular eyes. It almost looks like it’s wearing a mask. Juvenile blue racers have a different appearance from adults. These young snakes are brown or gray with darker brown or gray splotches running down their back. The splotches have a black border. Newly hatched blue racers can be up to 14 inches in length! A two- or three-year-old juvenile blue racer has lost this scale pattern and taken on the adult’s beautiful electric blue or gray coloration. How to identify a blue racer snake: Blue racers don’t have venom. The fact that they are not poisonous makes them less dangerous than a lot of other snakes in North America like the timber rattlesnake or the eastern coral snake . But, not so fast! The bite of a blue racer snake is said to be very painful. A bite wound from a blue racer snake usually causes quite a bit of bleeding. So, when providing first-aid for a bite, firmly hold a soft cloth on the wound to stop the bleeding. Next, wash the wound with soap and water. Cover the wound with a clean bandage and monitor it as it heals. Sometimes an infection can develop due to bacteria from the snake’s bite or dirt that gets into the wound. If redness or swelling occurs, go to a medical professional to have the bite wound examined. You may need antibiotics for an infection. The speed and timid nature of these snakes makes them a rare sight. If it sees a human approaching, this snake can easily slither away to hide beneath a pile of brush or in a burrow. People living in the territory of this snake can take steps to increase their chances of seeing one. Someone who has property near a grassy meadow or field may want to leave a few areas of tall grass on their property. These areas are attractive to blue racer snakes. Just think of all the places to hide! Plus, encouraging blue racers can contribute to decreasing the rodent population near your property."

    "Name": "Red Winged Blackbird",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats seeds, grains, nuts, insects, snails, frogs",
    "Text": "The red-winged blackbird is found almost everywhere across North America except for deserts and mountains. The male is easily identified by the black glossy feathers and red shoulder patches. Its rich song can be heard every year beginning in the spring. It has also been known to attack people who wander too close to its territory. The red-winged blackbird is native to North America . Depending on the time of the year, it may be found anywhere from Alaska to the Caribbean and Central America . This species lives in a variety of different habits, including open fields and sparse deciduous forests, but its favorite habitat is fresh and saltwater marshes and wetlands. The red-winged blackbird constructs its nests in rushes, grasses, cattails, sedges, or other tall vegetation. The nest itself is made out of grasses and mosses lined with mud and branches. The scientific name of the red-winged blackbird is Agelaius phoeniceus . The genus name is derived from an ancient Greek word meaning gregarious; if you’re not familiar with this term, it describes the bird’s highly social behavior. The species name of phoeniceus is a Latin term meaning crimson or red. This species is closely related to other types of American blackbirds. The red-winged blackbird is characterized by a stout body, broad shoulders, and a slender cone-shaped bill. Like many other songbirds, there is a strong element of sexual dimorphism, meaning the sexes vary dramatically in appearance. The male is covered in glossy black feathers with red and yellow around the shoulders. This patch is thought to an adaptation that can puff up when feeling confident or threatened. It might even be a signal of the male’s aggressive levels. The female, by contrast, is characterized by brown plumage with dark stripes on the underside and white eyebrow markings. While the male is slightly larger, the average length of this species is 7 to 8 inches with a 12 to 15-inch wingspan. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The red-winged blackbird is a highly social species that roost and travels together in large groups. During the day, these groups break up to forage for food and then reform at night. Their behavior changes slightly in the mating season when a male will become a little more aggressive in the defense of its territory and its mates. It has been to attack much larger animals such as humans that encroach on its territory. While both sexes make a variety of different calls to communicate, the male is the only one capable of producing songs; one of the most important adaptations for attracting mates. They learn this song from other males as a juvenile. This species is also quite fast and agile in the air, flying at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Northern populations of the red-winged blackbird migrate in flocks of thousands for the winter toward the southern United States and Central America . Western and southern populations tend to remain in the same place year-round. The red-winged blackbird has an omnivorous diet. It will spend most of the day foraging on the ground and in trees. The red-winged blackbird will consume almost anything it can find, including seeds, nuts, grains, insects (like flies and butterflies ), snails , frogs , and carrion. The red-winged blackbird is considered to be a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. The biggest threat to this species over the last few centuries has been the loss of wetlands to make way for homes and buildings. Like many songbirds, it has adapted well to live near people, but this has sometimes led to accidents and clashes. While the bird is supposed to be protected by the US Migratory Treaty Act, it is sometimes deliberately hunted or poisoned. Natural predation and disease have also led to many premature deaths every year. The red-winged blackbird is preyed upon by raccoons , minks , owls, wrens, magpies , and birds of prey. It has evolved several adaptations to deal with predators, including the ability to conceal its nest in tall vegetation and roost in large groups. The blackbird’s mating season usually lasts between early spring and mid-summer. The male bird has evolved adaptations to initiate courtship with his elaborate song and a visual display involving the flapping of wings. A single male will normally have about five females in his territory to mate with. He is quite aggressive about defending his territory and will attack anyone who comes within the boundaries. The nest is built at some point in March to May (or even earlier in the south) near a marsh or other moist area. After copulating, the female will produce three to seven eggs per clutch with multiple clutches per breeding season. The development of the young is very rapid. The chicks hatch after about a week and start flying in 10 to 14 days. By the two or three week mark, they are already independent. The female bears most of the responsibility for raising the young, but the male does take part in feeding them when the mother is absent and also defending the territory. Due to predation and disease, the red-winged blackbird only lives for an average of about two years in the wild. If it can avoid an early death, then it has a more reasonable lifespan. The oldest known member of this species lived nearly 16 years. The IUCN Red List currently estimates that there are 210 million individual red-winged blackbirds alive in the wild today. However, numbers appear to be in decline."

    "Name": "Palm Rat Characteristics And Behaviors",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects, small mammals and birds and enjoys seeds, fruit, stems, leaves, fungi",
    "Text": "The Palm rat’s official name is Rattus Rattus , also known as the black rat, the house rat, and the ship rat. Palm rats are native to North America and tend to live in the warmer regions and more coastal parts of the country. And because distinguishing between the different types of rat species can be challenging, we use this space to describe Palm rat characteristics and behaviors. Palm rats have scraggly, coarse fur and are often black or light brown. Their bellies are frequently lighter in comparison to the rest of their bodies. Interestingly, domesticated house rats were bred in England during the 1920s, and one of these variations had a green-tinted fur. Regarding the size of the Palm rat, the adults generally reach 5 to 7.2 inches and have tails of six to nine inches long. Adult Palm rats typically weigh between two to eight ounces. But, the black rat’s weight depends on its subspecies, with the bucks or male rats becoming heavier than the females or does. Many people confuse the Palm rat with the Norway rat. However, Palm rats have thinner bodies and weigh less than Norway rats. Their tails are also a good indicator of their differences. The tail of a Palm rat is longer than its body, while the tail of a Norway rat is shorter than its body. In addition, their noses vary, with the Palm rat having a sharper nose than the Norway rat. The Palm rat’s coat is also darker than the Norway rat’s. Palm rats prefer living in environments with cooler weather and are known to live in colonies rather than alone. As their name suggests, roof rats are prone to climbing and living in high spaces, like roofs and attics. Although black rats prefer living in high places, they live on the ground, in garbage dumps, and under porches, if they have to. Palm rats live near densely grown areas and fruit trees in the wild. Palm rats reproduce no matter the season. They reach sexual maturity around three months and produce a litter of five to eight rat pups. Does can birth up to five litters per year, but this depends on her surroundings. In areas where ship rats have access to food, water, and shelter, like in urban and suburban areas , they may reproduce fastly and form huge colonies in a short amount of time. House rats are omnivorous mammals and have adapted their diet to suit their surroundings, which means they are generalists. These rats generally eat 0.53 ounces of daily food and 15 milliliters of liquid daily. Usually, the diet of a black rat consists of seeds, fruit, stems, leaves, fungi, insects, small mammals, and birds . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Farmers and homeowners consider these rodents to be pests as they will eat the food meant for cows, swine, chickens , cats, and dogs. Besides animal feed, These rats will eat crops like cereals, sugar cane, coconuts, cocoa, oranges, and coffee beans. Additionally, these rats threaten wildlife as they hunt and feed on birds, insects , and smaller rodents. Palm rats are also excellent foragers because they are generalists. These rats will partner with each other to forage and hunt together. They do most of their food scouring after sunset and will hide and store their finds if they can’t eat quickly enough when interrupted. Although black, ship, or Palm rats are dietary generalists, they are also picky eaters. They choose to eat a range of dominant foods that they favor. They do this to monitor the quality of available food, such as seasonal foods, insects, and birds. Black rats also do this to maintain their nutrition intake and avoid taking in toxins due to over-eating a specific food. Black rats favor using soft materials when making a nest. Common materials found in this rats’ nests are twigs, grasses, and other delicate plants found in the area. Ship rats also use man-made materials like shredded paper, fabric, and home insulation materials. All rats are known to be disease carriers and have caused significant loss of lives in the past when hygiene in cities was not at a premium. Today, they still introduce diseases to cities and towns throughout the world. Some of the sicknesses that Palm rats carry that can infect people include: House rats also carry a range of bacteria and viruses that can lead to humans and animals becoming infected, with some being incurable. Some of the bacterial diseases carried by these rodents are: A ship or house rate can make a good pet as they are calm and peaceful. House rats are a smaller species and are perfect for holding in your hand. These rats are also playful and curious, which makes them an ideal pet for kids. Unlike many other rodent species, adult ship rats become calmer with age. They also stay healthy and are not usually prone to developing tumors or becoming obese. Potential pet owners also need to know that Palm rats are nocturnal. This characteristic means you must place their cage in a quiet and calm space. Rat owners must also ensure their pet rats have treats and toys to chew on to grind their teeth. Since rat teeth never stop growing, they should always have something to gnaw on to ensure they remain a healthy length."

    "Name": "Evening Grosbeak",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats seeds, berries, buds, fruit, sap, and insects and enjoys box elder, ash, maple",
    "Text": "“Evening grosbeaks are common at backyard feeders.” The evening grosbeak ( Hesperiphona vespertina) is a large, heavyset bird with a thick conical bill native to North America. It inhabits coniferous forests in Canada and the Northern United States and frequents much of the US’s urban and suburban areas during the winter. Look to the tops of trees where they forage for food and listen for their short whistles and sparrow-like calls. Discover this fascinating North American bird , including where it lives, what it eats, and how it behaves. The evening grosbeak lives in North America in three countries, including the United States , Canada, and Mexico. They live year-round in Southern Canada and the Pacific Northwest in the United States. Some populations migrate for the winter by moving south into much of the US and some parts of Mexico. They breed in mature coniferous forests , mainly spruce-fir, pine-oak, and aspen. Wintering grosbeaks live in coniferous and deciduous forests, suburbs, and urban areas . Migratory birds often spend much of their time at backyard feeders. Be sure to leave out sunflower seeds on a platform feeder to attract them to your yard! Females build their nests on a horizontal tree branch away from the trunk or on a vertical fork, up to 100 feet above the ground. The nest is a loosely constructed cup made of twigs and lined with grass, moss, and pine needles. The evening grosbeak ( Hesperiphona vespertina) is in the Fringillidae family, encompassing the true finches, small to medium-sized birds with stout conical-shaped beaks. Its genus, Hesperiphona, also comprises the finches. Its specific name, Vespertina, is Latin for “evening.” The evening grosbeak is a large, chunky bird with thick conical bills. They measure 6.3 to 7.1 inches long and weigh 1.9 to 2.6 ounces, with an 11.8 to 14.2-inch wingspan. This bird also has a short tail, a broad chest, and a thick neck. Adult males have bright yellow foreheads and bodies, with a brown head and a large white patch on its wing. Females are olive-brown with gray underparts. Both sexes feature black tails and wings and pale bills. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . These grosbeaks are social birds often found in flocks, especially in winter. They break off into small groups and pairs during the breeding season. They are friendly with those in their species and show very little aggression toward one another. This species also does not defend its feeding territories due to the abundance of food in its habitats. Their songs are short, with musical whistles, and their calls sound like a house sparrow . Evening grosbeaks are residents to irregular migrants. Populations in Southern Canada and the Pacific Northwest in the United States live year-round in their environments. Other northern populations will only migrate when cone crops in coniferous forests are low. They typically only migrate further south into the United States and Mexico every two to three years. Evening grosbeaks are omnivores that feed on the tops of trees and shrubs. Most of their diet comes from seeds, especially box elder, ash, and maple. They also eat berries, buds, small fruit, weed seeds, maple sap, and insects . This bird consumes gravel for minerals and frequently graces backyard feeders with sunflower seeds. They forage on the tops of trees and shrubs and occasionally on the ground. They forage in flocks outside of the nesting season. The IUCN lists the evening grosbeak as VU or “vulnerable.” Their range and population are still relatively large, but studies suggest this species is on a steep and rapid decline. There doesn’t appear to be one specific cause for this decline; there are likely many causes. Their most significant threats include urbanization, the logging industry, invasive species, and pollution. These birds are also susceptible to the effects of climate change and may suffer from spring heat waves and wildfires in the future. The most significant predator of the evening grosbeak is domestic cats. But they may fall victim to jays, hawks, grackles, and squirrels . This species is not particularly quarrelsome but may give alarm calls to warn of intruders. While they are not aggressive birds, they will chase away woodpeckers , cowbirds, and robins. Evening grosbeaks form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and mate quietly without producing elaborate songs and displays. Males occasionally perform a little vibrating dance during courtship. Females lay between two and five (three to four on average) pale blue-green eggs with brown, purple, or gray blotches. They incubate for 11 to 13 days while the males bring them food. Both parents feed the nestling, and the young fledge the nest around two weeks after hatching. This species produces one to two broods per year. They live an average of 5.5 years but can reach up to 16. The global evening grosbeak population is estimated to number 3.4 million mature individuals. Despite its seemingly large population, this grosbeak has undergone a significant and steep decline in North America over the last 40 years. Some research suggests their numbers have decreased by 94% since 1970. Scientists have not yet identified the reason for its steep decline. However, many factors can contribute."

    "Name": "Anole Lizard",
    "Diet": "Omnivore that eats insects",
    "Text": "The name Anole Lizard refers to one of over 400 species of mostly color-changing lizards located primarily in South and Central America. One of the most charming residents of the North American garden is the little green anole lizard. Curious and occasionally friendly, these bright green reptiles can be seen darting across deck rails and rearing their heads above flower pots. They hunt for moths among begonias and take flies for a snack with lightning-quick precision. There is a single species, the Green Anole, Anolis carolinensis , native to North America , which is sometimes called the American Chameleon. Though many anole lizards can exhibit color adaptations to their environment, the anole lizard differs from true Chameleons in many ways, not least in their very limited ability for color change. In most species, the male and female differ, most commonly because the males have a brightly colored dewlap on the necks, but males and females may also be characterized by size and sometimes nose length. Another species, the Brown Anole ( A. sagrei ), can be found in parts of the United States , but is considered an invasive species and has a negative effect on local ecosystems. A few other species, including the Knight Anole ( A. equestris ) are also found in Florida but are introduced species and not native to the area. Anoles come from the family Dactyloidae under the Class Reptilia. Because there are over 400 species, it would be impossible to list all their scientific names here. Collectively, they are called Anolis. Some of the subspecies are: See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The size and color of each anole lizard species will differ depending on habitat, climate, and diet. Depending on where they live and how they hunt, they may have physical adaptations such as large hind legs for jumping large distances for prey, or short stubby legs if they live higher up in trees and creep up slowly on prey to avoid detection by their predators when hunting. They come in many colors, though the most common colors are a range of greens and browns, with yellow and sometimes blue variations. Most male anole lizards have a dewlap, which is a piece of erectile tissue on the neck, which can be collapsed and extended into a semi-oval shape. The dewlaps of the male can be almost any color, and usually, the color differs greatly from the lizard’s body. Anoles are mostly solitary. They may live near each other but are not generally found in groups. Males aggressively defend their territory during sexual maturity, otherwise, they are typically docile and tolerate humans to varying degrees. Various behavioral adaptations occur depending on the environment in which they live. Ancestors of the green anole lizard hail from Cuba, and long ago spread across the southeastern United States. These little green lizards are now sold in pet stores and have recently become the subjects of several evolutionary scientific studies. The evolution of animal species is often portrayed as a process that takes place over thousands of years – and that is often the case. But sometimes, as they say, needs must. The North American green anole offers an example of evolution at warp speed. It was a case of evolve or die. The green anole lizard is the only anole species native to the United States, and for most of their history, they have lived on or around the base of trees where insects abound. Someone brought brown anoles into the country in the 1950s, and those highly invasive lizards quickly began to drive the green anoles from the forest floor to higher branches. Rather than die out, the green anoles forged a new life in the trees and on higher ground. They became expert climbers and found new places to hunt. Amazingly, over a span of a mere 20 generations and 15 years, the green anoles evolved larger toe pads covered with more sticky scales to make climbing easier. According to scientists, this is a perfect example of “character displacement,” an evolutionary process that allows two closely related species to diverge and take advantage of separate niches. Other studies have proven that the resilient little lizards have evolved to tolerate colder temperatures after surviving extreme cold snaps in some states – while city anoles evolved stickier feet to make climbing up buildings easier. As a species, green anoles have learned to go with the flow to survive. Most anole lizard species live in or near trees, though some live near the base and some prefer the smaller limbs near the top. Their hunting styles will differ depending on their locations. Anole lizards may be found in bushes, reeds, low limbs, tree trunks, and forest canopies. They are found in many ecosystems, including on farms, in residential yards, in rainforests, dry forests, arid scrub, grasslands, and in riverside vegetation. Almost all anoles are insectivores, though some will also consume some vegetation and nectar. Anoles are hunters who feed primarily on insects , spiders, and other invertebrates , but may also consume nectar, tree sap, and occasionally rotted fruit. Larger species may consume smaller or baby lizards, snakes , and eggs. One threat to anoles is other anoles. For instance, when they share a habitat, Brown Anoles will eat Green Anoles and their eggs. They are also prey for larger reptiles and snakes, as well as many predatory birds and a few small mammals . Their color-changing abilities afford them some protection from predators, but they are vulnerable during mating when they increase their movements and show off brighter colors. Typically, when males reach sexual maturity, they will hunt for a mate by flexing their dewlap and sometimes doing what looks like push-ups. These pushups are also used as a show of strength to discourage other males from entering the mating territory. Both males and females are polyamorous, mating with multiple partners over their lifespans. Male anoles defend a singular territory so that they can have exclusive access to females that enter into or live within that territory. However, the females wander outside the territories and mate with other males also. When a mate is found, the female will lay one or two eggs after copulation, often every day through the mating season. A baby will hatch at about 0.75 inches in size. A baby anole will reach sexual maturity at about 18 months and have a lifespan of two (wild) to seven years (captive). Populations vary widely between species with Green Anoles being estimated at around 100,000 specimens or more and the Blue Anole so rare that it may be headed for extinction."

    "Name": "Blue Gray Gnatcatcher",
    "Diet": "Insectivore that eats insects",
    "Text": "“A Blue-gray gnatcatcher can snatch insects out of mid-air” One of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher’s most notable features is the cap of deep blue feathers on its head. Another notable feature is a call that sounds like spee, spee! Blue-gray gnatcatchers live in open woods, scrubs, and thickets. Flies, small wasps, beetles , and spiders are all in its diet. The Blue-gray gnatcatcher is native to North America and lives in a temperate climate. These birds are year-round residents in many states along the southern coast of the United States . This range includes the southern part of California traveling east to Florida and up into southern parts of Georgia and South Carolina . Some are permanent residents of Mexico and Cuba as well. There are some Blue-gray gnatcatchers that make their home in northern parts of the United States. But birds living in northern states such as Michigan and Wisconsin migrate south for the winter. Sometimes they travel as far as Mexico. These birds start migrating south in September. The breeding season for this bird runs from March or April into late July. This is a great time to see these birds at work building nests and feeding their chicks. So, if you see a couple of Blue-gray gnatcatchers building a nest remember that joy and happiness are two words in the spiritual meaning of this feathered creature. In the springtime, the male Blue-gray gnatcatcher sings its song to attract females to the area. Once he finds a mate, nest construction begins. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The nest design is a cup shape made with mud , grass, and twigs. Animal hair and grass are put on the inside of the nest to serve as a soft layer for the eggs. Both male and female Blue-gray gnatcatchers work together to apply a layer of spider webs and lichen to the exterior of the nest. This helps hide it from predators. These birds usually build their nest at a height of 20 to 40 feet in a tree. Polioptila caerulea is the scientific name of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher. The Greek word Polioptila means gray plumage and the word caerulea means blue. It’s in the Aves class and the Polioptilidae family. Well, the name of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher says a lot about the appearance and behavior of this bird. Yes, this bird has bluish-gray feathers on its back and wings along with a cap of deeper blue feathers on its head. Its breast is white. Blue-gray gnatcatchers have a long, thin, pointed beak. Its beak design allows it to pluck an insect out of the air. Capturing insects in mid-air is called hawking. Its long tail feathers contain both black and white feathers. This bird flicks its tail feathers side to side to frighten insects out of bushes. Male Blue-gray gnatcatchers are larger than females. Plus, a male has a black stripe extending from the base of its beak, over each eye, and across each side of its head. The length of a Blue-gray gnatcatcher is four to five inches, and its height is three to four inches. It’s very light, weighing just .21 ounces. The wingspan of this bird is 6.3 inches. The dark color of the Blue-gray gnatcatcher gives it an advantage when it’s trying to blend into its wooded habitat. The thin, pointed beak of this bird helps it to get a firm hold on its prey. The Blue-gray gnatcatcher covers the outside of its nest with spider webs and lichen. Once again, this is an attempt to hide the nest from snakes, hawks, and other predators able to get into the treetops to kill an adult bird or steal an egg. This bird uses its call to warn other Blue-gray gnatcatchers of predators. Blue-gray gnatcatchers living in the northern parts of the United States migrate south to warmer weather for the winter season. In late September, birds living in Michigan, Wisconsin, southern Montana, and other northern states start on a southward path. Some of these birds stay in southern states such as Florida, Georgia, or Texas for the winter. Other Blue-gray gnatcatchers travel further south into Mexico. In the spring, these migratory birds fly north again for the breeding season starting in March or April. Does a Blue-gray gnatcatcher look like a carnivore to you? It is! In fact, some biologists call this bird an insectivore because of its diet of insects. This bird eats flies , leafhoppers, small wasps , spiders, and caterpillars . Along with capturing insects in mid-air, they also hop along the branches of a tree looking for bugs on leaves. One interesting behavior of this bird is it will pick up a leaf-covered twig and shake it. This is an effort to scare the insects out from beneath the leaves. This tiny bird has lots of predators including snakes , hawks , kestrels , and cats . All of these animals are able to chase after Blue-gray gnatcatchers even if they try to escape into the trees. Loss of habitat is an issue for Blue-gray gnatcatchers, but it’s not considered of major concern. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reports this bird as Least Concern with a population that is rising. Male Blue-gray gnatcatchers attract females with their song. A male and female Blue-gray gnatcatcher pair up during the breeding season. However, biologists aren’t sure whether they stay together for life. These birds begin breeding in March or April. A female has four or five eggs that hatch in just 13 days. Both the male and the female take turns going out to find food for their babies, or chicks. The chicks grow quickly and are able to leave the nest at about 14 or 15 days old. Typically, these birds live up to four years of age. But there is one Blue-gray gnatcatcher on record as having lived four years, two months! Despite not having a specific population listed on their IUCN Red List of Threatened Species page, this bird is thought to be of Least Concern. Furthermore, its numbers are estimated to be on the rise."
