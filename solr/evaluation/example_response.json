    "Text": "Aardvarks are small pig-like mammals that are found inhabiting a wide range of different habitats throughout Africa, south of the Sahara. They are mostly solitary and spend their days sleeping in underground burrows to protect themselves from the heat of the African sun, emerging in the cooler evening to search for food. Their name originates from the Afrikaans language in South Africa and means Earth Pig due to their long snout and pig-like body. Aardvarks are unique among animals as they are the only surviving species in their animal family. Until recently, it was widely believed that they were most closely related to other insectivores, such as armadillos and pangolins. However, this is not the case with their closest living relatives actually thought to be elephants. The Aardvark (Orycteropus afer), also known as an antbear, is very unique in terms of its evolutionary makeup. It has been assessed as having the highest score for evolutionary distinctiveness, according to the EDGE scientific method. This is because it does not have many close relatives and has been evolving independently for millions of years. The Aardvark is the sole surviving species of its order, Tubulidentata, and its closest relatives have been extinct since the Pleistocene era (2 million years ago). Through millions of years, species have split off and changed in various ways, providing proof of their common ancestor and showing that evolution is still at work. However, some species have remained virtually unchanged since their ancient origins and are referred to as living fossils. An example of this is the aardvark, which is an intriguing example of this evolutionary phenomenon. The aardvark’s unique physical attributes stem from its evolutionary background as an ancient species. Its scientific name, Tubulidentata, alludes to one of its most peculiar features: its teeth. Unlike the teeth of most mammals, which consist of one main pulp-cavity covered with a layer of dentin and enamel, an aardvark’s tooth is composed of hundreds of individual straw-like tubes held together by the same material that holds our teeth in place. To make matters more interesting, these tubes are constantly being replaced and regrown; a single aardvark tooth can have up to 1,500 of these small channels. Humans have developed more advanced teeth than the primitive 12-14 that aardvarks possess, yet aardvarks are still able to consume 50,000 ants and termites in one night with their sticky tongues. Similar to early mammals, they possess a proto-gizzard that helps to grind up their food as if they had teeth. Scientists have found that the aardvark’s genes are highly conserved, meaning they are much more similar to the DNA of early mammals than other species. This suggests that the aardvark has not evolved much since ancient times. Nature may sometimes revise its creations, but the aardvark is an example of something that cannot be improved. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Aardvarks have a unique appearance among mammals (and indeed all animals) as they display the physical characteristics of a number of different animal species. They have medium-sized, almost hairless bodies and long snouts that make them look distinctly pig-like at first, with thick skin that both protects them from the hot sun and also from being harmed by insect bites. They are able to close their nostrils to stop dust and insects from entering their nose. They have tubular, rabbit-like ears that can stand on end but can also be folded flat to prevent dirt from entering them when they are underground. Aardvarks have strong claws on each of their spade-like feet that, along with the fact that their hind legs are longer than their front legs, make them strong and capable diggers able to excavate vast amounts of earth at an alarming rate. Due to the fact that they spend most of their lives underground or out hunting in the dark at night, they have poor eyesight but are able to easily navigate their surrounding using their excellent sense of smell to both find prey and sense potential danger. Aardvarks are found in a wide variety of different habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa , from dry deserts to moist rainforest regions. The only stipulation (other than having good access to plenty of food and water) is to have good soil in which they can dig their extensive burrows. Despite being highly skilled at digging in sandy or clay soil types, rockier regions prove more of a challenge to create their underground homes, so the aardvark will move to another area where soil conditions are better suited to digging. Their burrows can be up to 33 feet long in a home range that can be anywhere from one to two square miles. Their burrows often have multiple entrances and are always left head first, so they are able to identify potential predators easily using their keen sense of smell. Aardvarks are mainly solitary animals that come together only to mate and are never found in large groups. They live in underground burrows to protect them both from the hot daytime sun and from predators. Aardvarks are nocturnal mammals, only leaving the safety of the burrow under the cover of night when they go in search of food and water, often traveling several miles in order to find the biggest termite mounds guided by their excellent hearing and sense of smell. Despite often having a large burrow comprised of an extensive network of tunnels, aardvarks are also known to be able to quickly excavate small temporary burrows where they can protect themselves quickly rather than having to return to their original dwelling. Aardvarks have specific mating seasons that occur every year. Depending on the region in which the aardvark lives, young can be born either in October to November or May to June in other areas. Known to have babies most years, female aardvarks give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that usually lasts for around seven months. Newborn aardvarks often weigh as little as four pounds and are born with hairless, pink skin in the safety of their mother’s burrow. Baby aardvarks spend the first two weeks of their lives in the safety of the underground burrow before beginning to venture out with their mother under the cover of night. However, despite accompanying their mother in search of food, they aren’t weaned until they are around three months old. Young aardvarks live with their mother in her burrow until they are around six months old, when they move out to dig a burrow of their own. Although their lifespan in the wild is not entirely clear, aardvarks tend to live for more than 20 years in captivity. The diet of aardvarks is mainly comprised of ants and termites, with termites being their preferred food source. Despite this, they are known to also eat other insects, such as beetles and insect larvae. Aardvarks are built to be insectivores with strong limbs and claws that are capable of breaking into the harder outer shell of termite mounds very efficiently. Once they have broken into the mound, they then use their long, sticky tongue to harvest the insects inside and eat them whole without chewing as they are then ground down in their muscular stomachs. One of the aardvark’s most distinctive features is the fact that they have columnar cheek teeth that serve no functional purpose at all. With some larger ant species that need to be chewed, they use the incisors that are located towards the back of their mouths. Aardvarks are also able to use the same techniques to break into underground ant nests. Despite the fact that aardvarks are nocturnal animals that live in the safety of underground burrows, they are threatened by a number of different predators throughout their natural environment. Lions , leopards, hyenas, and large snakes (most notably pythons) are the main predators of aardvark, but this does vary depending on where the aardvark lives. Their main form of defense is to escape very quickly underground. However, they are also known to be quite aggressive when threatened by these larger animals. Aardvarks use their strong, sharp claws to try and injure their attacker, along with kicking the threatening animal with their powerful back legs. Aardvarks are also threatened by humans who hunt them and destroy their natural habitats. Aardvarks use their long, sticky tongue to lap up to 50,000 insects a night from inside termite mounds or underground ant nests. Their worm-like tongues can actually grow up to 30 cm in length, meaning they can reach more termites further into the mound. Their love of insects has actually led to aardvarks being called Antbears! Interestingly enough, aardvarks are also thought to get almost all of the moisture they need from their prey, meaning that they actually have to physically drink very little water. Aardvarks are thought to be one of the world’s most prolific diggers, with their strong limbs and claws and shovel-like feet helping them to be able to shift two feet of soil in just 15 seconds! Due to the fact that they spend the daytime hours hidden in the safety of their underground burrows, only emerging under the cover of night to hunt for food, aardvarks are very seldom seen by many people. In some regions, though, they are hunted by people for food and are becoming increasingly affected by expanding human populations as more of their natural habitats disappear to make way for growing settlements. Today, aardvarks are listed by the IUCN as a species that is of Least Concern. Despite the fact that population numbers of aardvarks most certainly declined in some countries, in others, their numbers remain stable, and they are often commonly found in both protected areas and regions with suitable habitats. They are becoming increasingly affected by habitat loss in both the form of deforestation and expanding towns and villages. Due to their incredibly elusive nature, exact population sizes are not fully understood.",

    "Text": "“Aardwolves play a positive role in the ecosystem by limiting the number of termites throughout their natural range.” The aardwolf is the lesser-known cousin of the striped , brown, and spotted hyenas. Because it’s shy, elusive, and nocturnal, it’s rarely encountered by people. The name aardwolf essentially means earth wolf in the Afrikaans and Dutch languages, but this is misleading because it’s not a wolf at all. Instead, it belongs to the hyena family, a fact which is fairly obvious from its appearance alone. It looks quite a bit like a striped hyena, whose African habitat overlaps with its own. This article will cover some interesting facts about the identification, diet, habitat, and behavior of the aardwolf. As just mentioned, the aardwolf is a member of the hyena family, and its appearance is quite similar to a hyena. The main differences are that the aardwolves are generally smaller in body size, they live in smaller groups of family units, and they consume insects rather than carrion or larger prey. The scientific name of the aardwolf is Proteles cristata . The genus name Proteles, which essentially means “complete in front” in Greek, refers to the fact that it has five toes on the front limbs and only four on the hind limbs. Cristata comes from a Latin word that means a comb or tuft on the head of an animal (referring to its luxurious mane). See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . There are two subspecies of the aardwolf: Proteles cristatus cristatus lives in Southern Africa, and Proteles cristatus septentrionalis lives in eastern and northeastern Africa. Together with the brown hyena , spotted hyena, and striped hyena , the aardwolf is a member of the family Hyaenidae. It was once placed in its own separate family, but this is no longer considered to be correct. Aardwolves are thought to be an example of a “primitive” hyena. This essentially means they may have evolved from a very early branch of the hyena family before the other three species came to be. Based on genetic and fossil evidence, they probably diverged from the rest of the hyena family at some point between 15 and 32 million years ago. It was once thought that the aardwolf may not be a hyena at all, but rather a closely related species mimicking the appearance of the striped hyena to trick potential predators, but this explanation has fallen out of favor as scientists have gathered more evidence. The aardwolf might be accidentally mistaken for a hyena if you don’t know what key identification markers to look for. The most prominent feature is the strong dark stripes against a backdrop of brown or yellow fur with additional black markings around the feet, tail, and muzzle. It also has a thick mane running from the head to the tail and large triangle-shaped ears. However, compared with most hyenas, it also has five toes on the front feet instead of four. Most members of the species are about three feet long and weigh between 17 to 31 pounds. This makes them the smallest member of the hyena family. Males and females look almost identical in coloration and size. Because of their shy and elusive behavior, there is still a lot about the aardwolves we don’t yet understand. For a long time, it was thought that the aardwolf was a solitary creature. But in fact, as we’ve since learned, the basic unit of the aardwolf’s social life appears to be the family, which consists of a breeding pair and their immediate offspring. There is little evidence it forms larger packs or groups for long periods. The breeding pair raises the offspring together nearly all year long and defends their territory against outside aggressors. They may create as many as 10 dens, as well as several waste disposal areas, within their territory. The den is usually composed of a simple hole, crevice, or abandoned porcupine or aardvark burrow in the ground. Aardwolves do most of their communicating with the scent markings of their anal gland. This scent is smeared all over foliage to mark their territory and attract mates. They tend to make very few sounds unless they are threatened or startled. The only exceptions are some clucking, barking, and roaring sounds. If it’s in direct danger, then the hairs on the back of the mane will stand up and it may emit a foul-smelling substance from the anal gland. The aardwolf may also chase the intruder out of its territory, but given the slow speed, it may prefer to let the intruder go. Only when the aardwolf is faster will it overtake the other animal and instigate a fight. Despite the strong bond between the mating pair, the aardwolf appears to do most of its foraging alone without the help of its partner. As a nocturnal animal, it comes out at night to do most of its feeding, and then it retreats to the underground den during the daylight hours to avoid the withering heat. This behavior may change during the winter months when it comes out for some time in the afternoon and then sleeps at night. There is some evidence to suggest that the aardwolf may share part of its territory or hunt in small groups when food is particularly scarce. This maximizes their chances of finding food. The aardwolf prefers to inhabit dry open savannas and grasslands with minimal annual rainfall. It can be found in two separate disconnected places, thus the two subspecies have developed from the separation: the eastern horn of Africa around Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and the southern portion of Africa around Angola, Zambia, and South Africa. There is some debate about whether these eastern and southern populations should be considered as entirely separate subspecies because apart from their distinctive ranges, they are otherwise similar. The aardwolf faces few significant threats in the wild because they generally keep to themselves and don’t bother humans too often. However, sometimes they are in danger of falling victim to hunting, motor accidents, and habitat loss from encroaching human habitats. Adult aardwolves have few serious predators in the wild, but the aardwolf puppy is vulnerable to jackals , lions , leopards , and other hyenas. Hunting dogs will also sometimes attack and kill the aardwolf. Aardwolves may look like fearsome predators, but their diet consists almost solely of termites . After locating the termite mounts through scent and sound, the aardwolf will dig up the quarry with its sharp claws. It will then lick the termites right off the ground with their long sticky tongue. It’s estimated that a single individual can consume around 300,000 termites every single night. The termites also supply them with most of the water they need in their otherwise dry and arid habitats. Aardwolves are immune to the toxins that these termites produce to stop other predators from eating them. If termites are not available, then they might consume beetles and other insects. Contrary to expectation, they do not appear to scavenge for carrion at all like other hyenas, butt they might consume insects right off a dead body. The aardwolf’s mating season can conceivably take place at any time of the year, but depending on where it lives, breeding often peaks in the rainy months. To attract a potential mate, both males and females will secrete a pungent scent from the anal gland. If the female accepts what the male has to offer, then they will form pair bonds together and produce a single litter per year. However, the most aggressive males may intrude on another territory and copulate with the mate of a weaker male as well. After a gestation period lasting approximately 90 days, the mother will give birth to a litter of two to five pups with their eyes open but otherwise helpless. They will remain safe and protected in the underground den, feeding on the mother’s milk for the first three to four months of their lives. The father has the responsibility of guarding the den, while the mother will make foraging trips outside. When the offspring are fully weaned, each puppy will be fed regurgitated termites until they’re old enough to hunt on their own. These foraging trips become progressively bolder and farther from the den with each passing month. The aardwolf puppy will continue to learn and grow under the supervision of the parents for the first year. After that, they leave the family to stake out their territory. Most aardwolves achieve full sexual maturity at around 1.5 to two years of age. The lifespan of the aardwolf isn’t exactly known, but other closely related hyena species can live about 15 years or more in the wild. Aardwolves are considered to be a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List . This means numbers are healthy and they require no special conservation efforts. It is not known how many aardwolves live throughout their entire range, in part because their elusive and nocturnal behavior makes it hard to estimate. Based on the aardwolf’s behavior, however, we know that population densities are quite low. A single breeding pair can occupy territory as large as 1 to 4 square kilometers (0.4 to 1.5 square miles). The male will defend his territory both in and out of the breeding season.",

    "Text": "“ Abyssinian guinea pigs are one of the oldest breeds of guinea pigs, residing in the mountains of South America.” Despite the name, guinea pigs are not pigs at all but a type of rodent. They are known for their uniquely rough, rosette-patterned fur and ability to make loud noises. These animals make spectacular house pets and are very friendly. In fact, they have been popular house pets since the 1600s. They have a much more social personality than other guinea pig breeds, which is partly what makes them so popular. Scientifically known as Cavia porcellus, the Abyssinian is one of the oldest guinea pig breeds. Despite the name, the rodent did not originate in Abyssinia, now known as Ethiopia. While the actual origin of their name is largely unknown, like other breeds of guinea pigs, they inhabit mountainous areas in South America. This breed, like most others, is domesticated all across the globe. They are descendants of a rodent called Cavia cutleri, and their domestication likely first began around 5000 BCE. The Abyssinian guinea pig is a small rodent, about 8-12 inches in length, and it weighs about two to three pounds. For comparison, they are about the same size as an adult male’s shoe. Abyssian guinea pigs look quite similar to other breeds of guinea pigs. They have long bodies, broad heads, and short faces. Their ears droop downwards and are shaped like petals. Some also have a lush bush of hair under their noses. A unique feature of the Abyssinian guinea pig is its rough, “rosette” patterned fur. Unlike other breeds, the Abyssinian doesn’t have any flat or smooth spots. Instead, their fur usually has eight to 10 rosettes each, which are in pairs. They extend all over their bodies, from head to toe. While rough, the fur grows circularly and could be as long as 2 inches. They come in a few different colors but primarily neutral shades. Their most popular colors are white, black, brown, brindle, roans, tortoiseshell, and red. In the wild, the Abyssinian guinea pig lives in groups called herds. These social animals are quite vocal and do not shy away often. The unique noise these rodents make is a high-pitched squeal or whistle. Although many live in the wild, they have been domesticated, so they’ve become quite accustomed to the indoors. They can live alone but prefer to be with more of their kind because they are social creatures. It’s recommended that you keep at least two of them if you’re considering having them as pets. Abyssinian guinea pigs are only found in South America in the wild, either in forest-covered areas, open grasslands, or in the mountainous regions of the Andes. They can survive in elevations of up to 16,000 feet above sea level! The Abyssinian guinea pig has a vast range and can be found from Venezuela to southern Patagonia, but they are not found in western Chile or most of the Amazon River basin. They are herbivores that feed on bushes, fresh vegetables, fruits, grass, and seeds. The diet of Abyssinian guinea pigs is plant based – making them herbivores. Out in the wild, their diet is largely based on grass, leaves, seeds, bark, and flowers on the mountain slopes of South America. In captivity, they can eat manufactured nutrition pellets, hay, and various fruits and vegetables. Overall, their diet resembles that of most other guinea pig breeds. Timothy hay, a grassy form of hay that is important for their diets, is often fed in captivity. They also need vegetables in their diet for them to fulfill their vitamin and mineral requirements. Usually, green, leafy vegetables are sufficient. Additionally, adding fruits to their diet can boost their digestive system and vitamin C intake. Their main predators are mammals such as weasels and birds of prey like eagles and hawks. In a home environment, they might be susceptible to attacks from domesticated cats or dogs. In South America, guinea pigs are a common food source. As mentioned above, these guinea pigs are susceptible to being preyed on by larger animals, particularly mammals and predatory birds. Nevertheless, they’ve developed natural instincts to help them survive. They usually escape by hiding in burrows, where larger animals cannot enter. Although deforestation negatively affects some guinea pigs, these animals adapt well to change, so human factors and climate change do not affect the population much. The Abyssinian guinea pig usually reaches sexual maturity at three months old. Out in the wild, these animals have no specific breeding season and can breed at any time of the year. However, having babies in the winter is often rare. Their gestation period is between 58 to 72 days, and a female gives birth to between five and 15 pups at one time. Over the year, a female might give birth to up to five litters. The babies are known as pups. They are usually very well-developed when they’re born and have long hair – a feature unique to them. They usually suckle on their mother’s milk for up to 21 days, after which they can graze independently. A single litter of pups can range from five up to 15! The average lifespan of an Abyssinian guinea pig is anywhere between five and eight years. And the longest-living Abyssinian guinea pig on record reached 15 years in captivity. In terms of diseases, they are susceptible to some common ailments. A few are as follows: Therefore, if you keep one as a pet, you should schedule regular vet visits and provide a well-balanced diet. The overall population of the Abyssinian guinea pig is currently unknown. There might be a chance of their population declining, considering modern-day urbanization and deforestation. Nevertheless, information about these trends is based on speculation. Abyssinian guinea pigs make great pets. They are docile, social, and loving animals that are relatively easy to take care of. A staggering 1.5 million households in the United States alone own guinea pigs. So it goes without saying that these are popular pets. Abyssinian guinea pigs are commonly found in zoos around the world. You can visit them in some of the following zoos in the USA:",

    "Text": "Perhaps too much emphasis is given to the uncertain point of origin of the Abyssinian cat. What truly matters is that this friendly, intelligent, curious, and companionable animal is here among us today. A lover of high places and eternally interested in watching what you are doing, the Abyssinian’s exquisite list of traits is the perfect answer that cat fanciers can offer to those who love their dogs. It can do so many dog-like things, yet it also knows where the litter box is and what it is used for. The origin of the Abyssinian cat breed is shrouded in mystery. It was once believed that the Abyssinians were cats imported from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), but the cat actually earned the name in reference to the Abyssinian War, and some cats during that period were imported by colonialists to Europe. These cats were exhibited in cat shows in the 1800s and called “Abyssinians.” But there’s no proof that those imported cats were true early Abyssinians. See all of our expert product reviews . Recent genetic tests have shown that the Abyssinian breed most likely originated in parts of Southeast Asia and the coast of the Indian Ocean. The earliest example of an Abyssinian is a taxidermal exhibit that was purchased between 1834 and 1836 by a museum supplier. It was labeled “Patrie, domestica India,” and is still on exhibit at the Leiden Zoological Museum in the Netherlands. The most important thing to know about an Abyssinian, or Aby for short, is that you are not getting a couch potato out of the deal. If you don’t want to be followed around and have a cat underfoot, you should think about some other pet. Abyssinians are born to superintend your activities or those of other members of your family. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . There are cats that like to be under things and cats that like to be above things. If you can’t find your Aby, then look up. Despite speculation that their ancestors came from a desert environment, the current breed is very fond of trees and other high perches. Abyssinians are famously good-natured so long as they have been properly introduced. They can peacefully co-exist with birds , dogs , small children, and even goldfish. If you’ve ever fancied having a cat that can play fetch, you may well get your wish with an Abyssinian. See all of our expert product reviews . If there is one complaint about an Abyssinian’s personality, it may perhaps be that they are almost too smart. They love to learn, and they learn by observing things at close quarters. This means that they are not shy about getting into your business while you are doing it. They are also very good at figuring out how to get into things or spaces that you may not want them in. These inquisitive creatures always want to know what’s on the other side of that barrier. One area that often surprises people about the Abyssinian personality is that they are very affectionate but notoriously disinterested in being a lap cat. They like curling up beside you, not on top of you. In this position, they are perfectly content to let you pet them and scratch their ears but they are not noted for being a cat you hold or carry around. While Abyssinians are open-minded about their companions in life, they do like having others of one sort or another around. No matter if it is a human or another cat, they are very sociable and can become bored and destructive if left alone too much. They have very loud motors when it comes to purring but they balance this with the rather sparse use of their voice. If they talk, it’s because there is a topic of importance they wish to discuss with you. The Abyssinian is a medium to small size breed of cat. Although medium in overall size, their very lithe build, and thin legs make them register on the smaller end of that medium scale so far as weight is concerned. Abys generally run from 8 to 10 inches in height and is anywhere from 12 to 16 inches in length. They tip the scales at a svelte 8 to 12 lbs. As purebred cats, Abyssinians are not inexpensive pets. Kittens can cost anywhere from $500 to $2200. Rarer Abyssinians and those coming from premier bloodlines can run all the way up to $5000. The wild card in this is that you can obtain an Abyssinian kitten for much less than these numbers indicate, but they are not capable of being used to breed more Abyssinians. For a so-called “pet” Aby, you can find common ones in the $500-900 range. Without getting into exotic toys, expensive foods, or unanticipated health issues, the average cost of maintaining an Abyssinian is about $400 a year. Like most other cats, Abyssinians have litters in the range of about six kittens. Kittens tend to be somewhat darker than their parents when born but will lighten up as their distinctive coat develops. They reach full height in about six months. After that, they gradually put on bulk until they are fully developed at around one year from their birth. Like their parents, the kittens are very playful and intelligent. They make wonderful pets for children to grow up with. Their curious nature and love of heights can artificially shorten their natural lifespan due to accidents. Barring any early death due to misadventure, however, Abyssinians easily last into the 13-15 year range. With proper care and diligence, living into their 20s is not too uncommon. Given the large initial investment in acquiring one, Aby owners usually watch their cat’s health very carefully and tend to their veterinary needs promptly. This means that Abyssinians are less likely to develop conditions that require them to be euthanized at an earlier age. Their longevity is also helped by their endomorphic body characteristics and their generally vigorous levels of activity throughout their lives. Conversely, the relatively small genetic stock of the breed has led to some lingering hereditary issues that appear more often in Abyssinians than in the general cat population. Among the diseases which most commonly afflict these cats are: To be a genuine Abyssinian, breeders require that a specimen must be one of four colors. Very slight variations of these color schemes are enough to disqualify a cat from being a cat breeder’s standard purebred Abyssinian. Black hair on a red Aby will disqualify. With few exceptions around the face, white patches or spots will disqualify. A dark necklace, or ring that goes entirely around the neck area, will disqualify. There are no recognized crossbreed Abyssinians. There is, however, a separate group called Silver Abyssinians which includes the colors: black silver, blue silver, fawn silver and sorrel silver.",

    "Text": "“ Search for these birds in the mid-story of tall trees and look for quick movements as they sally out to catch insects. ” The Acadian flycatcher ( Empidonax virescens) is a small passerine bird native to North and South America, where they inhabit wet riverside forests. They spend their days swiftly maneuvering through trees as they search for insects and small fruit. These solitary birds sing their songs early in the morning and defend their riverside nests with a monogamous partner. Discover all the fascinating Acadian flycatcher facts, including where they live, what they eat, and how they behave. Acadian flycatchers live in North and South America in over 15 countries, including the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and the Bahamas. Their range includes Southwestern Ontario and the Southeastern United States during spring and summer. They migrate through Mexico and Central America before reaching their wintering grounds in Northwestern South America. They breed in wet deciduous forests, such as swamps and dense riverside woods, and live in woodlands in their tropical winter homes. Search for these birds in the mid-story of tall trees and look for quick movements as they sally out to catch insects. They nest in tall trees or large shrubs in horizontal forks away from the trunk. Females form a loose cup made from weed stems, twigs, and grass and lined with plant down. They may use spider webs to hold the material together, but the nest often has a sloppy appearance making it look abandoned. The Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) belongs to the Passeriformes order in the Tyrannidae family, which encompasses the tyrant flycatchers with over 400 species. The Empidonax genus includes small flycatchers, and the name is Ancient Greek for “gnat” and “master.” They were discovered in Acadia (present-day Nova Scotia), but they do not inhabit this area today. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Acadian flycatchers are small passerine birds, measuring 5.5 to 5.9 inches long and weighing 0.4 to 0.5 ounces, with an 8.7 to 9.1-inch wingspan. They have long tails, broad bills, large heads, and long wings. Adults are olive-green above and whitish below, with dark wings and white wingbars. Their bills are dark above and orange-yellow below. These birds are mostly solitary, except during breeding, when they form monogamous pairs and nest near other flycatchers. They typically spend their time perched in the mid-canopy of their forest habitat, sallying out to catch insects and returning to their perch. They sing their songs early in the morning, an emphatic two-note “peet-seet!” The Acadian flycatcher is fun to watch as he quickly maneuvers through trees, using rapid wingbeats to take direct flights. Their exact speed is unknown. Acadian flycatchers are long-distance migrants who begin their spring migration in early March and their fall migration in mid-September. They breed in the southeastern portion of the United States, from South Dakota down to Texas and east through New York and Florida. During migration, they travel along the Gulf Coast down to Mexico and through Central America before reaching their wintering grounds in Northern South America (Colombia and Venezuela). Acadian flycatchers are primarily insectivores who forage by watching from a perch. Their diet consists of wasps , bees, caterpillars, ants, flies, beetles, moths, spiders, and millipedes. They also supplement their diet with some small fruits and berries. They select a perch from the mid-canopy, where they sit and watch before flying out to catch insects mid-air. This flycatcher will also snatch bugs from foliage while they hover. The IUCN lists the Acadian flycatcher as LC or “least concern.” Due to its extensive range and extremely large, stable population, this species does not meet the “threatened” status thresholds. Their biggest threats include habitat loss and degradation from forest clearing as a result of agricultural and urban developments. They also face future climate threats, like spring heat waves, which can endanger nestlings. Their predators include crows, hawks, owls, jays, cuckoos, domestic cats, rat snakes, squirrels, chipmunks, and mice. Their young are more likely to fall prey, but parents build their nests in trees hanging over bodies of water because they are easier to defend. Males give rapid alarm calls to warn of intruders and may become aggressive if necessary. Their breeding season falls between April and August, and they form monogamous long-term pair bonds, where they mate with one partner for many years. However, some males have been observed practicing polygamy and will mate with several females. Females lay two to four creamy white eggs and incubate them for 13 to 15 days. Their young fledge the nest when they can fly, around two weeks after hatching. The father feeds the fledglings while the mother begins incubating the second batch of eggs. They reach sexual maturity around one year and live an average of three years, but they can live up to 12. The global Acadian flycatcher population is estimated to number 5.2 million mature individuals. The species declined slowly from the 1970s to 2017, but recent trends suggest their numbers are stabilizing and possibly increasing slightly.",

    "Text": "This stick insect has an extremely small range and only lives in very small parts of dry deciduous forests in Madagascar. Achrioptera manga is a species of phasmid, also known as stick insects . These insects camouflage themselves by looking like sticks and leaves. Like many related insects, they can regrow their limbs through regeneration. This species is only found in a few forests in northern Madagascar, making them one of the rarest stick insects out there. The scientific name Achrioptera manga includes the Malagasy word for “blue” in reference to the male’s coloring. The A. manga belongs to the genus of Achrioptera . You can find this genus in some areas of Africa , including Madagascar. All members of this family have bright colors, though they can still blend into their environment. It does not have a common name but it, along with another similar and recently identified species in the genus Achrioptera , is often grouped as Malagasy Giant Stick Insects. Specimens of these insects were first collected in 2007. Prior to 2019, scientists classified the Achrioptera manga as Achrioptera fallax , a different species with a similar appearance. Both species in the genus Achrioptera differ from other stick insects in the males’ bright coloring, but while A. manga is blue, A. fallax is green. A. manga belongs to the Phasmatidae family, which contains some of the largest insects on the planet, and is part of the Phasmatodea order. An extinct superfamily of Phasmatodea called Susumanioidea was present during the Middle Jurassic 174.1 million years to 163.5 million years ago. The earliest fossil evidence of a leaf insect is Eophyllium messelensis , found in Germany dating back 47 million years to the Eocene Epoch. Often, humans find these insects bizarre and even threatening. However, stick insects pose no threat to humans. The males can reach 5.2-5.7 inches in length, while females are larger with wider bodies and typically reach 7.9-9.1 inches long on average. The males of this species are a bright blue color, although they are still capable of blending into their surroundings and can hide from potential predators. Females have brown colorations, allowing them to blend in more with their environment. Another difference between the males and females in appearance is that while both have sharp spines on their legs and thoraxes, the males usually also have spines on their heads, and females only sometimes do. These insects are mainly active during the day and especially when it is windy for reasons unknown. Their wings do not allow them to fly but when they are startled or threatened, they rub their second pair of wings together to create a rustling or buzzing noise and can try to pinch their hindlegs to trap a potential predator. It’s possible that the males’ blue coloring is also meant to ward off predators as it could suggest toxicity in the wild. Their neck glands emit repellent substances as a defense mechanism against potential predators. This insect has an extremely small range. As far as experts can tell, they only live in very small parts of dry deciduous forests in northern Madagascar, including Montagne des Français and Foret d’Orangea. This species has yet to be studied in-depth so their exact range remains unknown. However, this species appears to live in similar habitats to other stick insects. Largely, they stay in the trees and on shrubs, which allows them to blend into their surroundings. No one has studied this insect in-depth to understand exactly what it eats. However, it remains likely that it is herbivorous and consumes solely the leaves of the surrounding trees, like other stick insects. The northern forests of Madagascar have many different tree species that this insect could consume. While this species could rely solely on one species of tree for their diet, experts expect that they consume a range of plants. A. manga has been observed in captivity to eat leaves from plants such as salal, bramble, eucalyptus, oak, and raspberry. Adult females seem to prefer drier leaves to fresh foliage. There is limited data available on A. manga , however, it could be suggested that this species faces some of the same threats that others with restricted ranges do. These could include humans putting the population at risk through actions leading to habitat loss and climate change bringing about negative environmental impact. However, as some of the northern forests became protected around 2016, heavy logging is no longer a threat to these habitats. Unlike other species of stick insects, the Achrioptera manga’s mating season is year-round and mating occurs regularly. Males will only initiate mating efforts once they gain their blue coloring, indicating it may be to help them attract females. Following mating, the male stays with the female for a few days, and after the female lays around 40-50 eggs, she moves them to foliage with her abdomen. The incubation period is for 4-5 months and males gain their blue coloring within a week of hatching. Males reach maturity at around 4-5 months and females are mature at 5-6 months. The lifespan of the A. manga is believed to be about several months. This species is not currently classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and its conservation status is unknown. The number of these insects in the wild is also unknown. This species is becoming more available as a pet so this may assist in growing numbers. It’s possible that as it is only found in a number of habitats in Madagascar, further research into the Achrioptera manga may show that its population is at risk.",

    "Text": "The ackie monitor has a spiny tail which it uses as in self-defense. They are one of the smaller species of monitor lizards . Their name comes from the pronunciation of their specific name “ acanthurus .” In addition to this, they are also called spiny-tailed monitors because of their spiny tails which they use for self-defense. They come in two colors, red and yellow, with the red ackie monitors being the larger type. They are active lizards and known to make great pets , provided the proper space and diet. The scientific name of the ackie monitor is Varanus acanthurus . The name “ackie” comes from the pronunciation of the Latin specific name “ACK-anthurus.” They are also called ridge-tailed monitors, spiny-tailed monitors, or ackies dwarf monitors. They were once divided into three subspecies: Although originally thought to be different species, DNA tests have proven that the red and yellow ackie monitors are the same species and are both Varanus acanthurus . The fate of the Island ridge-tail monitor ( Varanus acanthurus insulanicus ), however, is still under heavy speculation after DNA analyses and research by ecologists to be a different species from the former two entirely. They belong to the Varanidae family with other carnivorous lizards such as the Asian water monitor and Blackthroat monitor. Ackie monitors are generally medium-size, lengthy and slender lizards. They have short legs, tapered snouts, a snakelike tongue, and a long tail. Their tail is so long, it makes up over half of the lizard’s entire length. It also cover in scales which resemble spines, hence their nicknames. They typically have three pale stripes on their pointed head that streak down to their neck. Red and yellow ackie monitors are classified by the colors of the spots on their backs. Their bodies are usually brown, black-brown, or red with red, cream, or yellow spots. Their undersides are typically pale and bare. Red ackie monitors are much larger than yellow ackies, and rarer as well. They are dark brown with reddish-orange spottings with dark spots inside them. Around the tail, these spots transform into stripes. Yellow ackie monitors look almost exactly like their red counterparts, all except the coloring. Yellow ackies have base colors ranging from brown to a dark golden and are covered in spots that are yellow, yellowish-orange, and cream. The pattern of these spots transform into stripes as it gets to the tail, similar to the red ackie monitor. Yellow ackies typically have shorter tails then red ackies. Although red ackies are larger than yellow ackies when it comes to size, both of these monitors are still relatively small compared to most other monitor lizards. They are known as “dwarf” monitors for this reason. They are usually about two feet long, with their tails making up half of this length, but some have been recorded to be as small as 17.3 inches and up to two and a half feet. Males are usually bigger than the females and have more pronounced features such as larger, bulkier heads, and coarse spines under their tails. Female ackies have smaller heads and smooth scales under their tails. They are docile, curious, and intelligent lizards. Yellow ackies are usually kept as pets rather than red ackies. They make some of the best monitor pets , given the proper care and shelter they require. They have a good temperament and can live in captivity for up to 15-20 years. Ackie monitors are gentle and do not typically get defensive unless mishandled, or afraid. When handling them, it is important to start small by caressing the lizard first before picking it up. You can also be present in their enclosure for periods of time without touching them to allow them to get used to you. Ackie monitors in the wild mostly use their spiny tails as a means of self-defense. When threatened, they wedge themselves in-between rock crevices and block the opening with their tails. These reptiles are diurnal, which means that they are active during the day and prefer rest at night. They also prefer hot weather, basking in temperatures as hot as 172 degrees Fahrenheit as opposed to cooler night weather around 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Ackie monitors are very active lizards, and as such, great care and attention must be provided to those in captivity. This species cannot thrive in a small environment. They require abundant space, which can be expensive. Ackie monitors are a burrowing species, and spend considerable amounts of time underground. They also need enough space to be able to move around and climb. While some handlers have successfully kept more than one ackie monitor in the same enclosure, this is not advisable. They are solitary animals and should be kept in separate enclosures. Ackie monitor lizards are terrestrial lizards with origins in the arid woodland and scrubland areas of the north, west, and center regions of Australia, as well as some of the islands off of the northern coast of the continent. The red ackie monitor lizards are typically located in the northwestern part of Australia while the yellow ackie is predominant in the central part of the country. Ackie monitor lizards prefer hot, dry weather with enough rocks and boulders which provide them with crevices to shelter in, including burrowing space. These burrowing spaces are especially dire for the ackie monitor lizards as they enable them to control and regulate their temperatures and humidity. They rely greatly on the humidity from these burrows to keep them hydrated enough to withstand the dryness of their environments. Ackie monitors that are kept as pets are predominantly bred in captivity. The ackie monitor is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . The ackie monitor can have a lengthy and full life if kept in good and stable conditions. In captivity, it can live 15-20 years. If you ever get stuck trying to tell the male ackie monitors from the females, you can try observing some of their physical traits. Female ackie monitors are usually smaller with narrower heads and smooth scales under their tail. Male ackie monitors are larger in size, have bulkier heads and coarse scales under their tail. If this isn’t accurate enough for you, you can try the hemipenal transillumination method, which involves using a non-heating light source around the tail of the animal to determine its sex. In the wild, the mating season for ackie monitors usually take place from December to March. Breeding occurs from spring to summer. However, in captivity, it can occur at any given time. The males initiates the process, and the male and female can typically mate on and off for a period of about five days. After this, the female locates a good spot with a temperature of around 86 degrees Fahrenheit to lay her eggs. Once a suitable spot is located, the female monitor will dig tunnels and lay her eggs there in about 20 days, after which she will require enough food and water to nurse herself back to health. When it comes to sexual reproduction, females have it quite hard. Therefore, it is important to make sure that they are of optimal health before considering breeding. If the nutritional and temperature conditions are optimal, the female monitor can produce more clutches of eggs. Females can lay up to 6 clutches annually, providing around 6-18 eggs per clutch. The ackie monitor offspring will hatch after three to five months of incubation. The hatchlings measure about six inches. Maturation for males occurs when the young lizard measures 12 inches, and the females 10-14 inches. Adults reach lengths of two to two-and-a-half-feet. Ackie monitors are carnivorous lizards, feeding primarily on arthropods and other invertebrates such as caterpillars , worms , spiders , grasshoppers , snails , crickets , cockroaches , beetles , ticks , and cicadas . They also prey on smaller lizards, such as geckos and skinks , and this feeding source accounts for around one-third of its diet. Whole animal prey such as small rodents can also be given to the ackie monitor sporadically, depending on the weight of the lizard in order to prevent obesity. Pet monitor owners should consider that since about 70% of the ackie monitor’s water source comes from the food it eats, it should be given prey items which can provide this amount. Owners might get tempted to go the easy route and feed your ackie monitor pet regular cat or dog food, but this is not a good idea. Monitor lizards have a different digestive system from your other mammalian pets and these canned and processed foods will not provide your monitor with its proper dietary requirements. For ackie monitors in captivity, it is advised that calcium and vitamin powder supplements be brushed onto their food items to supplement their daily requirements. This is important as it will help prevent bone diseases that monitor lizards in captivity are susceptible to. In the wild, they get preyed upon by snakes , raptors, as well as other monitor lizards . Since they are a smaller species of monitor lizards, these predators hunt the adults, the juveniles, and even eat their eggs. Ackie monitors in captivity mostly face health-related issues. One of such issues is metabolic bone disease (MBD) which results from inadequate calcium intake. Lack of calcium to fortify the bones of the lizard causes the bones to become weak and fragile, leading to movement restriction and, eventually, death. Another health issue that ackie monitors in captivity could potentially face is obesity. This comes as a result of excess feeding, and also feeding lizards with too much fatty prey such as mealy worms and whole prey like rodents. They are very active creatures and their diet should reflect this. It is strongly advised to feed these reptiles primarily with leaner insects such as crickets or beetles and keep fatty worms as occasional treats.",

Read on for more facts about the addax. Here are five facts about this superb but endangered antelope: The white antelope’s scientific name is Addax nasomaculatus . Addax is believed to come from an Arab word for “crooked horn.” Nasomaculatus comes from the Latin nasus for “nose” and maculatus , which means “spotted.” So the name Addax nasomaculatus probably translates as “animal with crooked horns and spotted nose.” The Addax is part of the Bovidae family, like bison and buffalo . There is only one species of addax, and there are no subspecies.  See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The addax is noted not only for the beautiful color of its coat, but also and especially for its spiral horns. Males are a little bigger than females and stand about 41 to 45 inches at the shoulder compared to females, who stand 37 to 43 inches at the shoulder. Males are also heavier and weigh between 220 and 276 pounds, while females weigh between 130 and 200 pounds. The coat of A. nasomaculatus changes with the seasons. It is mostly gray-brown in winter with white legs and rump. The coat turns almost entirely white or blond in the summer. There is a tuft of brown hair on the head between the horns, and this flows down into a mane. There are patches on the nose that make an X shape on the face. The animal’s sense of smell and peripheral vision are excellent, two adaptations that help them follow the rains. The animal also has a beard, notably red nostrils, and a short tail that ends in a black tassel. The addax’s legs are short, and though the legs and feet are built for endurance they are not built for speed. To onlookers, it seems as if the animal’s “knees” hardly bend as it moves. This makes it easy prey for predators such as lions, hyenas, and humans . The horns can be as long as 33 inches, though the longest horns were 43 inches in length. The horns have 30 to 35 ridges in the center and the bottom. Males use their horns to spar with other males over females. Addax lives in herds, which some biologists claim are headed by the alpha male while others claim are headed by the alpha female. They do know that females sort themselves into a hierarchy, with the oldest females being dominant. The males establish territories and guard the females within them. Though herds used to be large, nowadays they are made up of 5 to 20 individuals. Addax herds travel long distances to find vegetation, following the rains. Interestingly, Addax is largely nocturnal, as the cooler night temperatures make it easier for them to move around. In the heat of the day, they lie down in shady depressions Their light-colored coats also keep them cool by reflecting the heat. A. nasomaculatus is a creature of the desert, but it also migrates to savannas and grasslands. Unfortunately, it has been extirpated from many of the areas where it used to range freely such as Egypt , Mauritania , Algeria , Libya, Sudan ,and Western Sahara . The addax is hanging on in Chad and Niger and has been reintroduced by conservationists to Morocco and Tunisia . The white antelope eats grasses and the leaves of small trees and shrubs/bushes and leguminous herbs. These plant foods give the animal enough water so that it doesn’t have to drink. Because they can’t outrun their predators, Addax has always been subject to predation by carnivores such as leopards, hyenas, and cheetahs . Even if they could run fast, they are not a match for the humans who value their meat and hides or want a trophy head with those striking horns on the wall. Because of this, the antelope’s population has been shrinking since the middle of the 19th century, and it is now critically endangered . However, there are thousands of addax in zoos and private menageries, and conservation strategies have been adopted in several countries, including Algeria and Morocco . Addax also tends to harbor parasites when conditions are moist. The most common parasite of the antelope tends to be types of nematodes. The female addax is ready to breed when she’s about one a half years old, and the male is ready when he’s about three. Since males guard females in their territory, the dominant male mates with the fertile females in his herd. Though addax can breed throughout the year, they mostly do so in the earliest spring or late winter. The female gives birth to one calf after a pregnancy that’s a little less than nine months. Calves weigh about 11 pounds at birth and are weaned when they are about seven months old. The female goes back into estrus just a couple of days after giving birth. The lifespan of the white antelope is about 19 years in the wild, but another six years or so can be added to the lifespan of the animal if it is well cared for in captivity. There are probably 500 or fewer of these antelopes remaining in the wild, though there are probably thousands in zoos or private menageries. Breeding programs have been established to help the wild populations, and addax has been reintroduced into regions where they were once abundant such as Tunisia’s Bou-Hedma National Park and the Grand Erg Oriental in the Sahara Desert.",

    "Text": "The Adelie Penguin is the smallest and most widely distributed species of Penguin in the Southern Ocean and is one of only two species of Penguin found on the Antarctic mainland (the other being the much larger Emperor Penguin). The Adelie Penguin was named in 1840 by French explorer Jules Dumont d’Urville who named the Penguin after his wife, Adelie. Adelie Penguins have adapted well to life in the Antarctic as this migratory Birds winter in the northern pack-ice before returning south to the Antarctic coast for the warmer summer months. The Adelie Penguin is one of the most easily identifiable Penguin species with a blue-black back and completely white chest and belly. The head and beak of the Adelie Penguin are both black, with a distinctive white ring around each eye. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . The strong, pink feet of the Adelie Penguin are tough and bumpy with nails that not only aid the Adelie Penguin in climbing the rocky cliffs to reach its nesting grounds but also help to push them along when they are sliding (rowing) along the ice. Adelie Penguins also use their webbed feet along with their small flippers to propel them along when swimming in cold waters. The Adelie Penguin is one of the southernmost Birds in the world as it is found along the Antarctic coastline and on the islands close to it. During the winter months, the Adelie Penguins migrate north where they inhabit large platforms of ice and have better access to food. During the warmer summer months, the Adelie Penguins return south where they head for the coastal beaches in search of ice-free ground on the rocky slopes where they can build their nests. More than half a million Adelie Penguins have formed one of the largest animal colonies in the world on Ross Island, an island formed by the activities of four monstrous volcanoes in the Ross Sea. Like all species of Penguin, the Adelie Penguin is a highly sociable animal, gathering in large groups known as colonies, which often number thousands of Penguin individuals. Although Adelie Penguins are not known to be terribly territorial, it is not uncommon for adults to become aggressive over nesting sites, and have even been known to steal rocks from the nests of their neighbors. Adelie Penguins are also known to hunt in groups as it is thought to reduce the risk of being eaten by hungry predators. Adelie Penguins are constantly interacting with one another, with body language and specific eye movements thought to be the most common forms of communication. Adelie Penguins return to their breeding grounds during the Antarctic summer months of November and December. Their soft feet are well designed for walking on land making the trek to their nesting ground much easier as the Penguin fasts during this time. Adelie Penguin pairs mate for life in large colonies, with females laying two eggs a couple of days apart into a nest built from rocks. Both the male and female take in turns incubating their eggs while the other goes off to feed, for up to 10 days at a time. The Adelie Penguin chicks have an egg tooth which is a bump on the top of their beaks, which helps them to break out of the egg. Once hatched, the parents still take turns looking after their young while the other goes off to gather food. After about a month, the chicks congregate in groups called crèches and are able to fend for themselves at sea when they are between 2 and 3 months old. Adelie Penguins are strong and capable swimmers, obtaining all of their food from the sea. These Penguins primarily feed on krill which are found throughout the Antarctic ocean, as well as Molluscs, Squid, and small Fish. The record of fossilized eggshells accumulated in the Adelie Penguin colonies over the last 38,000 years reveals a sudden change from a Fish-based diet to Krill that started two hundred years ago. This is thought to be due to the decline of the Antarctic Fur Seal in the late 1700s and Baleen Whales in the twentieth century. The reduction of competition from these predators has resulted in there being an abundance of Krill, which the Adelie Penguins are now able to exploit as an easier source of food. Adult Adelie Penguins have no land-based predators due to the uncompromising conditions that they inhabit. In the water however, the biggest threat to the Adelie Penguin is the Leopard Seal , which is one of the southernmost species of Seal and a dominant predator in the Southern Ocean. These Penguins have learned to avoid these predators by swimming in large groups and not walking on thin ice. The Killer Whale is the other main predator of the Adelie Penguin, although they normally hunt larger species of Penguins further north. South Polar Skuas are known to prey on the Adelie Penguin’s eggs if left unguarded, along with chicks that have strayed from a group. Adelie Penguins inhabit one of the coldest environments on Earth and so have a thick layer of fat under their skin helping to keep them warm. Their feathers help to insulate them and provide a waterproof layer for extra protection. The Adelie Penguin is a highly efficient hunter and is able to eat up to 2kg of food per day, with a breeding colony thought to consume around 9,000 tonnes of food over 24 hours. The flippers of the Adelie Penguin make them fantastic at swimming and they can dive to depths of 175 meters in search of food. Adelie Penguins do not have teeth as such but instead have tooth-shaped barbs on their tongue and on the roof of their mouths. These barbs do not exist for chewing but instead assist the Penguin to swallow slippery prey. For interesting facts, Read “ 10 Incredible Adelie Penguin Facts “. A visit to the Adelie Penguin colonies has long since been on the program for tourists to the Antarctic, who marvel at the vast numbers of them nesting on the beaches and hunting in the surrounding waters. This has meant that Adelie Penguins are one of the most well-known of all Penguin species today. Early explorers, however, also hunted the Penguins both for their meat and their eggs in order to survive in such uncompromising conditions. Despite having been confined to living in coastal Antarctica, Adelie Penguins are one of the most common and widespread Penguins in the southern hemisphere. With more than 2.5 million breeding pairs found throughout southern Antarctica, the Adelie Penguin has adapted well to its polar habitat. Scientists have also been known to use Adelie Penguin nesting patterns as indicators of climate change, noticing that they are able to nest on beaches that were previously covered in ice. The Adelie Penguin is listed as Least Concern.",

    "Text": "Admiral butterflies are any of several species within the genera Limenitis and Vanessa . These insects are known for their flashy colors and patterns, some of which resemble the insignia of military officers. They survive mainly on nectar from flowers and the juices of rotting fruits or animal corpses, though they may also feed on urine or dung. Conservationists do not currently consider them endangered, though some species’ population sizes are unknown. The term “admiral butterfly” refers to a number of different species in the genus Limenitis (admirals), which occurs within the subfamily Limenitidinae (admirals and relatives). These species further belong to the family Nymphalidae (brush-footed butterflies) and the order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). As members of the class Insecta , which is the largest class within the phylum Arthropoda , they are true insects. Limenitidinae divides into four tribes: L imenitidini, Neptini, Parthenini, and Adoliadini . The genus Limenitis occurs within Limenitidini . Scientists dispute the number of species within Limenitis . Within North America, there are between two and six species, though taxonomists most commonly list the following four: There are more species in addition to these in Eurasia. These include: Additionally, certain species within the genus Vanessa (tribe Nymphalini ) qualify as red admirals, including the following: Admiral butterflies derive their name from their wing patterns, which look like the insignia of military officers. See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles . Admiral butterflies are agile, quick insects. They are famous for their flashy wing patterns, which typically consist of white bands and colorful markings across a black base. These markings come in a variety of hues, including red, orange, blue, and white. For example, Limenitis arthemis divides into red-spotted purple admirals (Limenitis arthemis arizonensis and Limenitis arthemis astyanax) and white-banded white admirals (Limenitis arthemis arthemis and Limenitis arthemis rubrofasciata) . By contrast, Lorquin’s admiral has brownish-black wings with two rows of white spots and orange wingtips. The red admiral has black wings with red bands and white spots. Like all butterflies, these insects have six jointed legs. As members of the family Nymphalidae , they possess reduced front legs, meaning they only stand and walk on their two rear leg pairs. As insects, their bodies are segmented into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. A pair of antennae helps them sense their environment via smell and touch. They see using compound eyes on either side of their heads. Admirals vary in size according to species. For example, the red admiral has a wingspan of between 1.75 and three inches, while that of Lorquin’s admiral ranges from 2.2 to 2.7 inches. Weidemeyer’s admiral measures between 2.25 and 3.75 inches, falling just short of the red-spotted purple or white admiral, which measures between 2.9 and 3.9 inches. Like most butterflies, admirals tend to be solitary except when mating. A common name for a group of butterflies is a “kaleidoscope.” This name derives from the optical toy. Other names include “swarm” and “flutter.” Admiral species are common across North and Central America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. They also range across Europe, Asia, and coastal countries in northern Africa. However, the red-spotted purple and white admirals, Lorquin’s admiral, and Weidemeyer’s admiral are all North American species. For example, the red-spotted purple mainly lives in the eastern United States from southern Canada to the Gulf Coast. However, the white admiral lives in more northerly regions, including further up into Canada. Between the four different species, they cover every U.S. state and much of southern Canada. Admirals inhabit a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, jungles, mountain ranges, orchards, near streams and marshes, and within urban areas. Some species, like the red admiral, are migratory, moving south in winter in search of warmer weather. Others take shelter where they are. Hibernating butterflies occasionally find their way into homes and other buildings in search of shelter. Though they are harmless, some homeowners may wish to relocate them outside. This will prevent the warmth of the house from waking them up prematurely. The earliest butterfly fossils formed about 40 million years ago during the mid-Eocene Epoch. Lepidopteran fossils from this period are strikingly similar to extant butterflies, including the fossilized species Prodryas persophone . However, some scientists think butterflies and moths may have begun their evolution as far back as the Cretaceous Period (145.5 to 65.5 million years ago) when angiosperms (flowering plants) first showed up in the fossil record. Butterflies most likely evolved from moths. In fact, some scientists have reclassified certain extant moth species as butterflies , such as those in the Hedylidae family. The two remain closely related, though moths are usually duller and less varied in color and pattern. Admiral butterflies are primarily herbivores . They survive by ingesting liquid from various sources. They also have a number of predators. These insects mainly feed on nectar from flowers and the liquid of rotting fruit. They also suck the sap from oozing trees. Other sources of nutrition include carcasses, urine, and dung. In the caterpillar stage, they feed on trees like birch, poplar, willow, and black cherry. Butterflies have a wide range of predators . These include larger animals like monkeys, birds, rats, snakes, frogs, toads, and lizards. Smaller predators include dragonflies, wasps, ants, flies, and spiders. Butterflies avoid predators in two ways : crypsis and mimicry. Crypsis, otherwise known as camouflage, is the art of blending in with one’s environment. Butterflies achieve this mainly with their wings, which they fold up to disguise their bright colors. However, sometimes they use these colors to their advantage through mimicry, which is the art of appearing to be something else. Many brightly-colored butterfly species are toxic. Even those that are harmless may use their flamboyant wings to appear deadly.",
