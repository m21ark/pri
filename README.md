## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To create an effective information retrieval system for animal data by leveraging Apache Solr.
- **Data Acquisition:** Obtained a substantial dataset from [A-Z-Animals.com](https://A-Z-Animals.com), ensuring coherence and completeness.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted analysis to evaluate dataset quality, identify fields, and understand information requirements.
- **Information Retrieval Phase:** Utilized Apache Solr to design and execute five search scenarios, collecting relevant metrics for comparison.
- **Search System Improvement:** Explored various strategies to enhance the search system's performance, with mixed success but evident improvement.

## Key Components

- **Dataset Analysis:** Detailed examination of the acquired animal dataset to ensure suitability for the information retrieval system.
- **Schema Design:** Creation of two schemas tailored for optimizing information retrieval within Apache Solr.
- **Search Scenarios:** Execution of five distinct search scenarios to evaluate system effectiveness and efficiency.
- **Metric Analysis:** Collection and analysis of metrics including precision, recall, F-Measure, and Mean Average Precision (MAP) to assess system performance.
- **System Enhancement:** Exploration of different approaches to improve search system results based on metric feedback.

## Usage

- **Data Processing:** Use provided scripts to preprocess and transform the animal dataset for optimal indexing.
- **Schema Configuration:** Adjust schema design based on specific project requirements and evaluation outcomes.
- **Query Execution:** Execute predefined search scenarios and collect relevant metrics for evaluation.
- **System Enhancement:** Experiment with different strategies to improve search system performance based on metric feedback.

## Results

- **Initial Metrics:** MAP of 49% indicated room for improvement, particularly in certain query scenarios.
- **Enhancement Efforts:** Despite mixed success, significant improvement observed in system performance.
- **Future Directions:** Opportunities for further refinement and enhancement to deliver valuable insights into animal information.

## Conclusion

The project successfully established a high-quality information retrieval system for animal data, leveraging Apache Solr. By combining a well-curated dataset with optimized search system configurations, the system demonstrates effectiveness in delivering relevant and valuable insights into the natural world.
